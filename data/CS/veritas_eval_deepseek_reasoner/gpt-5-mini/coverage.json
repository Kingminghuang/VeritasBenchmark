    "evaluation_report": "**I. Overall Conclusion**\nPlan B provides **partial coverage** of Plan A. It addresses many of Plan A's high-level themes (e.g., stages of review, evaluation of effectiveness) but does so from a fundamentally different perspective—socio-technical, ethical, and policy-focused—rather than the technical and application-focused survey that Plan A outlines. Consequently, Plan B omits detailed technical mechanisms, specific tool categorization, and a direct comparative analysis of AI models, which are central to Plan A.\n\n**II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis**\n\n*   **Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered (from a different perspective)\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan A's objective is to \"investigate and define the core thesis\" and establish a \"conceptual framework\" based on the three stages. Plan B's first objective (1) and its conceptual framing task (2) directly engage with this goal. However, Plan B's framework is not neutral; it is built around a specific critical research question concerning how AI \"challenges and redefines\" scholarly quality, labor, and contribution. Plan A seeks a descriptive framework, while Plan B seeks a critical, evaluative one. The stages (Pre/In/Post-Review) are used as an organizing principle in both.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan A requires a detailed survey and categorization of specific AI-driven applications and models (e.g., Evise, AgentReview, HLM-Cite). Plan B does not explicitly list or categorize tools in this manner. Instead, its empirical evidence collection (3) involves systematically gathering data on \"model/tool names\" and \"usage context\" as part of a broader metadata capture. The goal is not to create a taxonomy of tools but to build a corpus for qualitative and quantitative analysis of their effects. Therefore, the *spirit* of surveying applications is present, but the *method* (a detailed catalog) is absent, making this a partial coverage.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Not Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** This is a significant omission. Plan A demands a deep technical analysis of specific mechanisms: algorithms for expertise modeling and COI detection, optimization paradigms for review generation (Single-Agent, Iterative, Multi-Agent), and techniques for argument extraction in meta-reviews. Plan B is entirely silent on these technical underpinnings. Its focus is on the outcomes, ethical concerns, and policy implications of these systems, not their architectural or algorithmic details. The \"Quantitative analyses\" (5) involve modeling outcomes but not reverse-engineering or analyzing the internal mechanics of the tools themselves.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered (implied, not explicit)\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan A calls for a direct \"comparative analysis of the different AI approaches\" based on performance criteria like accuracy and scalability. Plan B does not have a dedicated task for this. However, the quantitative analyses (5) involve comparing outcomes (e.g., acceptance patterns, time-to-decision) where AI is used versus not used. This indirectly touches on the \"efficiency\" and potentially \"quality\" criteria from Plan A but from an observational/empirical outcome-based perspective rather than a controlled, model-to-model comparative one. The focus on \"failure modes\" and \"biased-AI scenarios\" also relates to analyzing \"limitations.\"\n\n*   **Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered (and expanded upon)\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan A's goal to evaluate effectiveness in addressing systemic challenges (workload, delays, quality, fairness) is a central pillar of Plan B. This is the essence of Plan B's research question and is addressed through multiple tasks: Empirical evidence collection (3) gathers data on \"measured outcomes,\" Thematic synthesis (4) analyzes \"shifted human roles,\" and Quantitative analyses (5) directly \"compare outcomes\" and \"quantify harms.\" Plan B not only covers this point but expands it to include deeper ethical and societal implications like bias, epistemic authority, and credit.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered (from a different perspective)\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan A asks for a summary of research directions and open challenges, listing technical issues like algorithmic bias and model reasoning. Plan B addresses challenges like bias and reasoning capabilities indirectly through its focus on \"ethical and bias concerns\" (4) and \"failure modes\" (5). However, Plan B translates these technical challenges into a set of \"Governance, norms & policy interventions\" (6) and \"Prioritized research questions\" (9). For example, mitigating bias is not just an open challenge but a problem to be solved with specific policy interventions like audits and disclosure mandates. Plan B's summary is action-oriented (what should we *do*?) whereas Plan A's is knowledge-oriented (what do we need to *know*?).\n\n**III. Summary of Core Differences**\n\nThe core difference between Plan A and Plan B is one of **perspective and methodology**.\n\n*   **Plan A (Ground Truth)** adopts a **technical survey and analytical** perspective. It is structured as a systematic review and evaluation of AI *tools and their mechanisms*. Its methodology is centered on cataloging, technical dissection, and direct model-to-model comparison within a defined framework.\n*   **Plan B (Generated)** adopts a **socio-technical and policy-oriented** perspective. It is structured as an empirical study investigating the *impact and implications* of AI tools on the scholarly ecosystem. Its methodology is mixed-methods, combining qualitative coding, quantitative empirical analysis, simulations, and policy analysis to understand effects on quality, labor, fairness, and to produce governance recommendations.\n\nIn essence, Plan A seeks to answer **\"How do these AI systems work and how do they perform?\"** while Plan B seeks to answer **\"How is the use of AI in peer review changing science itself, and how should we govern it?\"** Plan B covers the \"why\" and \"so what\" of Plan A's subject matter but largely omits the detailed \"how\" of the underlying technology."

    "evaluation_report": "**I. Overall Conclusion**\nPlan B provides comprehensive and often expanded coverage of all the research points outlined in Plan A. It not only addresses each point but frequently enriches them with a strong emphasis on implementation, safety, governance, and reproducibility engineering, reflecting a more applied and systems-oriented perspective.\n\n**II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis**\n\n*   **Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B's section (3) \"Definitions and foundational concepts to establish\" directly corresponds to this point. It defines the core concepts and establishes a clear, detailed framework for the automated research lifecycle. The stages defined (Idea Mining, Novelty Assessment, Formalization/Theory Analysis, Verification, Simulation, Experimental Design, Execution, Analysis/Replication) map closely to Plan A's five stages, with Plan B offering a more granular breakdown (e.g., splitting \"Theory Analysis\" into \"Formalization\" and \"Verification,\" and adding explicit \"Simulation\" and \"Replication\" stages).\n\n*   **Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** This point is addressed throughout Plan B's extensive section (4) \"Stage-by-stage reconciliation strategies and methods.\" For each sub-point:\n        *   **a. Idea Mining:** Covered in section (4)(A), detailing techniques like LLM ensembles, diverse prompting, and RAG, aligning with Plan A's categories.\n        *   **b. Novelty Assessment:** Covered in section (4)(B), cataloging retrieval-based fact-checking, embedding-gap measures, and bibliometric indices, which encompass Plan A's traditional and LLM-augmented methods.\n        *   **c. Theory Analysis:** Covered in sections (4)(C) \"Probabilistic-to-symbolic bridging\" and (4)(D) \"Logical consistency & formal analysis,\" which detail formalization, evidence collection (via translation/transpilation), and verification analysis, including automated theorem provers.\n        *   **d. Experiment Conduction:** Covered in sections (4)(F) \"Automated experimental design,\" (4)(G) \"Automated execution & measurement,\" and (4)(H) \"Statistical & reproducibility pipeline.\" This maps the landscape of tools for design, pre-experiment estimation (power calculations), management (pre-registration, CI/CD), execution (lab automation), and analysis.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B covers the spirit of this point but from a more applied, rather than analytical, perspective. It describes *what* techniques are used (e.g., \"heterogeneous generators,\" \"controlled sampling,\" \"program synthesis\") but does not deeply analyze the underlying \"implementation mechanisms and operational principles\" as a primary goal. For example, it mentions \"diverse prompting strategies\" but does not propose to analyze them. It describes multi-agent systems implicitly in its orchestration of different AI agents and human roles but does not explicitly analyze their design for \"simulating team discussion.\" The analysis of feedback loops is present in the concept of \"verification gates\" and \"adjudication\" but is framed as an engineering requirement rather than a subject of mechanistic analysis.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** This is a central strength of Plan B. The entire document is structured around comparing and contrasting approaches, with a heavy focus on the trade-offs between automation and human collaboration. Section (7) \"Human-AI collaboration model\" explicitly defines the roles. Section (8) \"Metrics, acceptance criteria\" defines the factors for evaluation (originality/novelty, reproducibility, calibration). Sections (4) and (14) continually discuss the strengths and limitations of techniques (e.g., benefits of formalization, risks of LLM hallucinations, mitigation strategies) and their application contexts based on \"domain risk tiers\" defined in (9).\n\n*   **Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** This is the core purpose of Plan B as stated in its section (2). The entire outline describes an integrated, end-to-end, closed-loop pipeline. It directly addresses the challenges of integration: maintaining rigor through formalization and verification gates (sections 4C, 4D), ensuring interpretability through \"explainability\" and \"chain-of-evidence artifacts\" (section 4I), and validating outputs through replication and adjudication (sections 4H, 4I, 8). Section (11) \"R&D roadmap\" explicitly outlines the path to achieving this integration maturity.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B extensively covers this point. Section (11) \"Research & development roadmap\" is a direct response, outlining future challenges and prioritizing research questions (e.g., reliability of formalization, quantifying biases). Section (12) \"Validation experiments\" defines specific tasks to address methodological gaps. Sections (6) \"Bias detection,\" (9) \"Governance,\" and (10) \"Engineering practices\" all propose new avenues for improving reliability and trustworthiness. The concept of \"self-driving laboratories\" is addressed through the integration of lab automation (4G) and the overarching governance model.\n\n**III. Summary of Core Differences**\n\nThe core differences between Plan A and Plan B are of perspective, focus, and granularity:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework vs. Blueprint for Implementation:** Plan A reads as a proposal for a analytical review paper, aiming to investigate, survey, analyze, and evaluate the existing field. Plan B reads as a blueprint for building an actual Full-Automatic Discovery (FAD) *system*, focusing on design, engineering, and operational practices.\n2.  **Analysis of the \"What\" vs. Design of the \"How\":** Plan A seeks to understand the mechanisms and principles of existing techniques (the *what* and *why*). Plan B assumes these techniques and focuses on how to pragmatically combine them into a working pipeline, placing a much heavier emphasis on the *how* (e.g., provenance logging, containerization, CI/CD, pre-registration manifests).\n3.  **Expanded Scope on Safety and Governance:** A major differentiator is Plan B's deep and integrated focus on themes only briefly mentioned in Plan A (\"validating outputs,\" \"interpretability\"). Plan B dedicates entire sections to **ethics, risk management, governance, bias mitigation, and human oversight** (sections 6, 9, 14), reflecting a more mature and responsible approach to AI system design.\n4.  **Emphasis on Reproducibility Engineering:** Plan B introduces a strong, practical focus on reproducibility as an engineering discipline (sections 5, 10), which is implied but not explicitly detailed in Plan A's point on \"reproducibility.\"\n5.  **Granularity:** Plan B is significantly more detailed and granular, breaking down high-level concepts into actionable sub-tasks, technical specifications, and a phased implementation roadmap."

    "evaluation_report": "**I. Overall Conclusion**\nPlan B provides **partial coverage** of Plan A's research points, but from a fundamentally different perspective. Plan A outlines a comprehensive, descriptive survey and analysis of the existing landscape of AI for scientific research. In contrast, Plan B is a prescriptive research proposal focused on diagnosing a specific problem (the gap between task-specific and end-to-end evaluation) and then designing and validating a solution (an integrated evaluation framework). Plan B covers many of the same thematic areas but reorients them toward its specific diagnostic and prescriptive goals, resulting in significant omissions of Plan A's descriptive analysis requirements.\n\n**II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis**\n\n*   **Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B does not explicitly \"investigate and define\" the stages as a primary goal. However, it does adopt a very similar segmentation of the research lifecycle. In section `(1)(c)`, it defines the scope to include \"scientific research lifecycle stages considered (comprehension/survey, hypothesis generation, experiment design, experiment execution/simulation/data analysis, writing, peer review).\" This is a direct, albeit slightly more granular, mapping to Plan A's five stages. The coverage is partial because the intent is different; Plan B uses this segmentation to define its scope, whereas Plan A's point is to establish this segmentation as a foundational element of its survey.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B's section `(2) \"Landscape mapping: inventory of existing task-specific resources\"` directly corresponds to this point. It proposes creating a taxonomy by lifecycle stage and recording details like modality, task granularity, and metrics for each resource. This aligns with Plan A's goal of a \"systematic survey and categorization.\" The coverage is partial because Plan B's inventory is explicitly focused on \"task-specific\" resources to highlight the tension with end-to-end evaluation, potentially omitting tools or benchmarks that are designed for more integrated workflows, which would be included in Plan A's \"comprehensive inventory.\"\n\n*   **Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Not Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** This is a significant omission. Plan A requires an \"in-depth analysis of [each resource's] underlying methodology and design,\" including data sources, annotation processes, and core algorithms. Plan B's proposed inventory in section `(2)` is purely descriptive (naming, categorizing, listing metadata). It does not include a plan for the deep, methodological teardown of each resource that is central to Point (3) of Plan A. Plan B's analysis is focused on the systemic *effects* of these resources (the \"tensions\" in section `(3)`), not their internal architectures.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered (from a different perspective)\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan A calls for a comparative analysis of resources *within each stage* based on criteria like scope, complexity, and modality. Plan B does not perform this direct, stage-internal comparison. Instead, its entire section `(3) \"Identify the fundamental tensions and failure modes\"` is a form of comparative analysis *across all stages*, focusing on a single, meta-level criterion: the inadequacy of task-specific resources for evaluating end-to-end scientific capability. Points `(3)(a)` through `(3)(h)` (e.g., metric misalignment, compositional brittleness) are the result of this cross-stage comparative analysis. Therefore, the *subject* of the comparison is covered, but the *methodology and focus* of the comparison are different.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered (as a central thesis)\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan A's point to \"evaluate the maturity and capability of AI applications\" is the entire central thesis of Plan B. Plan B is built on the premise that current \"task-specific\" resources represent a low level of maturity (\"isolated assistance\") and that the field must move towards \"integrated, end-to-end automation\" evaluated by new frameworks. This evaluation is not presented as a descriptive finding but as the core problem statement driving the research. Sections `(4)`, `(5)`, `(6)`, and `(8)` are all dedicated to validating this evaluation and proposing a path forward.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered (and significantly expanded)\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B comprehensively addresses this point. The \"research gaps\" are detailed in section `(3)` (the failure modes). The \"future directions\" are the primary output of the proposal, elaborated across multiple sections: the \"Principles\" in `(5)`, the \"Concrete components\" in `(6)`, the \"Dataset and benchmark design practices\" in `(7)`, the \"Governance\" in `(9)`, and the \"Roadmap\" in `(10)`. Plan B goes far beyond summarizing gaps; it provides a detailed blueprint for addressing them, specifically focusing on the challenges of evaluation, integrity, and integration raised in Plan A.\n\n**III. Summary of Core Differences**\n\nThe core differences between Plan A and Plan B are fundamental to their purpose and methodology:\n\n1.  **Descriptive vs. Prescriptive:** Plan A is a **descriptive** survey aimed at mapping and analyzing the *current state* of the field. Plan B is a **prescriptive** research proposal aimed at diagnosing a flaw in the current state and then designing, validating, and implementing a *future solution* (a new evaluation framework).\n2.  **Breadth vs. Depth:** Plan A aims for comprehensive **breadth**, seeking to catalog and compare all relevant resources across all stages. Plan B seeks **depth** on a specific, critical issue (the evaluation gap), using the landscape inventory primarily as evidence to justify its deeper investigation into that issue.\n3.  **Analysis of Components vs. Analysis of Systems:** Plan A focuses on analyzing individual resources (datasets, benchmarks, tools). Plan B focuses on analyzing the *system* of evaluation itself, its incentives, and its failure modes when its components are composed.\n4.  **Output:** The output of Plan A would be a **review paper** summarizing the state-of-the-art. The output of Plan B would be a **novel evaluation framework**, a set of prototype benchmarks, and experimental results validating the new approach.\n\nIn essence, Plan B does not attempt to replicate Plan A. Instead, it assumes the findings of a plan like Plan A as its starting point and then proposes a necessary next step for the field, making it a complementary but distinctly different research endeavor."

    "evaluation_report": "**I. Overall Conclusion**\n\nPlan B provides **comprehensive coverage** of the research points outlined in Plan A. However, it does so from a distinct and more specialized perspective. While Plan A is a classic academic survey structure, Plan B is an executable research plan framed as a causal investigation into how the *evolution of retrieval methods enables the advancement of generation capabilities*. This lens causes Plan B to cover all of Plan A's points, but often by embedding them within a larger argument about technological progression and system architecture.\n\n---\n\n**II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis**\n\n*   **Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B's \"Step A: Scope & Definitions\" and the \"Definitions, scope, and evaluation criteria\" section of its high-level outline directly correspond to this point. It explicitly tasks itself with defining the core terms \"Related Work Retrieval\" and \"Overview Report Generation,\" which are the two fundamental stages defined in Plan A. The primary objective of automation is implicitly and explicitly covered throughout Plan B's narrative and is the central theme of its research goal.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered, with greater depth.\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B not only covers but expands on this point. The entire structure of its \"Historical / evolutionary narrative\" and \"Mechanism-level causal mapping\" sections is built around surveying and categorizing the principal paradigms: Semantic, Graph-Guided, LLM-Augmented, and Multi-Agent (which subsumes the \"deep research\" concept from Plan A). Plan B goes beyond detailing mechanisms to explicitly analyzing the causal links and outputs of each paradigm (\"What it produces\"), providing a more dynamic view than a simple categorization.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered, from a different perspective.\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan A's levels of automation (a, b, c) are comprehensively addressed in Plan B's \"Mechanism-level causal mapping\" and \"End-to-end pipeline architectures\" sections. The analysis is not presented as a static list of techniques but is dynamically mapped to the enabling retrieval artifacts. For example, \"Research Roadmap Mapping\" is shown as an output enabled by \"Graph-guided retrieval,\" and \"Document-level Survey Generation\" is framed as the outcome of \"Multi-agent orchestration.\" This reframes the analysis from \"levels of automation\" to \"capabilities unlocked by retrieval advances.\"\n\n*   **Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered.\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B covers the architectural contrast between agent-based systems and other approaches in its \"End-to-end pipeline architectures\" section (minimal vs. mid-level vs. full multi-agent pipeline). It also mentions specific tools and patterns that align with these frameworks (e.g., LangChain agents). However, it does **not** explicitly name and contrast the specific frameworks listed in Plan A (e.g., AutoSurvey vs. Bio-SIEVE). The comparison is done at the level of architectural paradigms rather than specific named implementations.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered, with significant expansion.\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** This point is thoroughly addressed in Plan B's dedicated \"Evaluation framework\" and \"Risks, limitations...\" sections. It explicitly lists metrics for evaluating \"semantic relevance\" (recall@k, coverage), \"logical coherence\" (coherence/fluency ratings), and \"synthesizing large volumes\" (coverage, redundancy rates). It expands on this by adding crucial evaluation dimensions like factuality, attribution correctness, and provenance, and proposes concrete experimental designs (\"Datasets, benchmarks & experimental designs\") to perform this evaluation.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered.\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B's \"Expected conclusions\" and \"Risks, limitations...\" sections directly cover the frontier research directions and challenges. Its hypotheses confirm the development of autonomous agents (\"multi-agent orchestration\"), improving integration (the entire causal narrative is about this integration), and ensuring factual accuracy (\"provenance fidelity,\" \"verification mechanisms\"). It adds concrete technical bottlenecks (evaluation metrics, data access constraints) to the future challenges listed in Plan A.\n\n---\n\n**III. Summary of Core Differences**\n\nThe core differences between Plan A and Plan B are ones of **perspective, focus, and output**:\n\n1.  **Academic Survey vs. Executable Research Plan:** Plan A outlines the structure of a final survey paper. Plan B is a meta-plan for *conducting the research* that would lead to such a paper, complete with assigned tools, team members (agents), and a phased timeline.\n2.  **Static Taxonomy vs. Dynamic Evolution:** Plan A proposes a static analysis and categorization of existing methods. Plan B frames the entire topic through a lens of *technological evolution and causal enablement*, seeking to show how advances in one area (retrieval) directly cause advances in another (generation).\n3.  **Conceptual Comparison vs. Architectural Implementation:** Plan A aims to compare the strengths and limitations of different conceptual approaches. Plan B delves deeper into the *practical architecture and implementation*, detailing pipeline components, data flow, and specific tooling required to build such systems.\n4.  **Evaluation Principles vs. Evaluation Framework:** Plan A states the need to evaluate effectiveness. Plan B provides a detailed, multi-faceted *evaluation framework* with specific metrics, proposed benchmarks, and experimental designs to carry out that evaluation empirically.\n\nIn essence, **Plan B covers all the substantive content of Plan A but recontextualizes it within an actionable, causal, and systems-oriented research agenda.** The only minor omission is the lack of direct comparison between specific named frameworks, which is superseded by a comparison of broader architectural patterns."

Plan A outlines a conceptual literature review and analysis, while Plan B presents a detailed project plan for *building and evaluating* a novel hybrid AI system. Therefore, Plan B covers the *substance* of many of Plan A's points implicitly through its proposed technical work and evaluation criteria, rather than explicitly as survey objectives.\n\n---\n\n**II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis**\n\n*   **Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered (from a different perspective).\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B does not explicitly \"investigate and define\" the core concept as a standalone objective. Instead, it operationalizes the concept through its entire proposed architecture. The \"Declarative Intermediate Representation (DIR)\" and \"Reasoning Orchestrator\" are designed to handle the two primary domains (text and tables/charts) by unifying them into a single processable format (Section F.2). The research goals (G1, G2) and the \"bottom-line recommended approach\" (M) implicitly establish the role of this system in accelerating AI4Research by reconciling reliability and depth.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered.\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B does not perform a direct survey and categorization of textual comprehension approaches. However, it demonstrates awareness of the landscape. Its \"Literature directions\" (E) list key techniques, grouping them into \"internal autonomy\" (e.g., CoT, PAL, ReAct) and \"external augmentation\" (e.g., Tool-Augmented LMs). This aligns with Plan A's \"semi-automatic\" (Human-Guided/Tool-Augmented) and \"fully-automatic\" (Summarization-guided/Self-Questioning) distinction, though the specific categorical labels differ. The coverage is a byproduct of the literature harvest steps (Step 1, Step 2) needed to inform the system's design.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered.\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Similar to Point (2), Plan B does not survey techniques for table and chart comprehension as a primary goal. However, it identifies key datasets (TabFact, ChartQA, PlotQA) and models (TaPas, TAPEX) that represent the state-of-the-art in its \"Literature directions\" (E). The technical decomposition (F.1) details the methods for parsing and converting visual data (\"chart object detection + data extraction\"), which corresponds to Plan A's \"methods for chart understanding.\" The proposed system's architecture is designed to handle these modalities.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered (in greater depth and from an implementation perspective).\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** This is a core strength of Plan B. It moves beyond analysis to a detailed design of the \"core implementation mechanisms.\"\n        *   **Tool-augmented systems:** Sections F.5 (Tool/Execution Layer) and F.6 (Verifier) detail how external knowledge is integrated and verified deterministically.\n        *   **Autonomous systems:** Section F.4 (Internal Reasoner) specifies the use of \"Constrained chain-of-thought\" and \"self-verification strategies\" like self-consistency.\n        *   **Non-textual methods:** Section F.1 (Input Normalizer) explicitly details methods for converting tables and charts into \"processable formats\" (CSV/JSON, plot de-embedding).\n\n*   **Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered (as a central research goal and evaluation metric).\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** The comparison of strengths and limitations is the central thesis of Plan B. Research Goal G1 is to \"characterize how reliability, scalability, and inferential depth trade-off.\" The evaluation metrics (H) are explicitly designed to measure these trade-offs (e.g., Faithfulness vs. Inferential Depth vs. Scalability & Cost). The proposed experiments (G) are structured to compare different paradigms (external-only, internal-only, hybrid) directly. This covers Plan A's request for evaluation on reliability, cost, scalability, and dependency on specialized data.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered.\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B addresses future challenges not as a summary, but as active risks to mitigate and research questions to answer.\n        *   **Mitigating factual errors (hallucinations)** is a primary risk and mitigation strategy (J.1).\n        *   **Advanced autonomous reasoning frameworks** are the subject of Research Questions Q2 and Q4 (on inferential depth and DIR design).\n        *   **Multimodal integration** is the entire purpose of the DIR schema and cross-modal synthesis tasks (G).\n        *   However, the challenge of \"improving performance on long-context documents\" is not explicitly mentioned in Plan B.\n\n---\n\n**III. Summary of Core Differences**\n\nThe core difference between Plan A and Plan B is one of **objective and perspective**.\n\n*   **Plan A (Ground Truth)** is a **conceptual review and analysis plan**. Its goal is to survey, categorize, analyze, and compare existing research in the field of AI for Scientific Comprehension. It is an academic exercise aimed at understanding the current landscape.\n*   **Plan B (AI-Generated)** is a **pragmatic engineering and research project plan**. Its goal is to *build a specific system* that synthesizes and advances the field. It uses the existing landscape (covered in Plan A) as a foundation to design, implement, and evaluate a novel solution (\"Reasoning Orchestrator\" with a \"DIR\") that aims to solve the very trade-offs analyzed in Plan A.\n\nIn essence, Plan A seeks to *understand the state of the art*, while Plan B seeks to *create the next state of the art*. This fundamental difference in purpose explains why Plan B covers the points of Plan A implicitly through its design and evaluation rationale rather than as explicit survey objectives."

It not only addresses each point but does so from a more structured, methodological, and verification-focused perspective, often adding significant depth, particularly in analyzing domain-specific challenges and validation strategies.\n\n**II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis**\n\n*   **Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B's sections (1a) \"Objective\" and (1b) \"Definitions\" directly correspond to this point. The objective establishes the foundational understanding by comparing AI applications across the specified disciplines. The definitions explicitly define core concepts like \"Automation,\" \"Discovery,\" and \"Insight generation,\" which are the key outcomes of applying AI technologies as mentioned in Plan A. While Plan A lists specific technologies (ML, LLMs, multi-agent), Plan B addresses them implicitly within its domain-specific method analyses (Section 4).\n\n*   **Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** This point is addressed in Plan B's Section (2) \"High-level mapping of AI roles across domains\" and Section (6) \"Per-domain case studies.\" Section (2) provides the requested high-level map by categorizing applications into \"Automation,\" \"Discovery,\" and \"Insight\" for Natural, Applied, and Social Sciences, effectively covering all the disciplines listed in Plan A (Physics, Biology/Medicine, Chemistry, Robotics, Software Engineering, Sociology, Psychology). Section (6) provides concrete examples (e.g., AlphaFold, sim-to-real RL, social media NLP analysis) that flesh out this map.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered (and expanded)\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B covers this point thoroughly. Section (4a) on Natural Sciences explicitly lists \"physics-/chemistry-informed ML (PINNs)\" and \"generative models,\" directly addressing the analysis of PINNs in physics and generative models in chemistry/biology. Section (6b) specifically names \"AlphaFold\" and \"closed-loop autonomous labs,\" covering the required deep dive into biology/medicine and chemistry. While \"AI-Newton\" and \"DrugAgent\" are not named, the concepts of \"symbolic regression\" (Section 6a) and \"multi-agent frameworks\" (implied in the analysis of challenges and methods) are present. Plan B adds significant depth by analyzing the \"why\" behind these methods in Section (3), discussing data types and constraints that necessitate such AI implementations.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered (and expanded)\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B's Sections (4b, 4c) on Applied and Social Sciences detail the dominant AI methods. Section (6c) on Robotics/Software Engineering covers \"sim-trained RL policies,\" \"domain randomization,\" and \"program synthesis and code-completion models,\" directly addressing end-to-end control, sim-to-real, and automated software development (e.g., ChatDev). Section (6d) on Social Sciences covers \"large-scale NLP analyses\" and \"causal evaluation,\" which encompass the social simulation and interview tools mentioned in Plan A. The \"impact\" is analyzed through the lens of challenges and verification in later sections (e.g., Sections 7, 8, 9).\n\n*   **Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered (in greater depth)\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** This is a core strength of Plan B. Section (7) \"Cross-domain contrasts that reveal fundamental differences\" is a direct and systematic response to this point. It explicitly compares \"Epistemology and model expectations,\" \"Data availability and experimental cost,\" and the \"Role of priors and constraints\" across the three domains. This analysis directly addresses the disparity in predictive reliability and maturity, explaining *why* accuracy is high in natural sciences (strong priors, high-quality data) and challenging in social sciences (weak priors, biased data). Sections (5) and (9) on domain-tailored validation metrics further reinforce this comparative evaluation.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Partially Covered\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B addresses the spirit of this point but not in a direct, comparative manner. The effectiveness of multi-agent systems and LLMs is not explicitly evaluated side-by-side across different tasks. However, the roles of these methodologies are discussed within domain-specific contexts: \"multi-agent/game-theoretic models\" in Section (8c) for human behavior, \"program synthesis and large models for code\" in Section (4b) for software engineering, and \"NLP transformers\" in Section (4c) for social sciences. The \"performance\" is implied through the discussion of associated challenges (Sections 8, 9) rather than through a dedicated comparative analysis.\n\n*   **Regarding Point (7) of Plan A:**\n    *   **Coverage Status:** Fully Covered (in greater depth and structure)\n    *   **Rationale and Analysis:** Plan B's Sections (8) \"Detailed challenge deep-dives,\" (11) \"Prioritized open research questions,\" and (15) \"Closing synthesis statements\" comprehensively cover this point. Section (8) delves deeply into future challenges like \"Integration of physical priors\" (related to robust, automated loops), \"Sim-to-real gap\" (robustness and safety), and \"Modeling complex, biased human behavior\" (ethical implications and biases). Section (11) provides a concrete list of \"Prioritized open research questions,\" which are the frontier research directions (e.g., hybridization of models, sim-to-real bounds, scalable causal learning). Section (15) synthesizes the future outlook, including the need for \"socio-technical governance.\"\n\n**III. Summary of Core Differences**\n\nThe core difference between the two plans lies in their perspective and organizational framework:\n\n*   **Plan A (Ground Truth)** is organized around **application examples and outcomes**. It is a content-driven plan that asks: \"What is being done (e.g., AlphaFold, PINNs, ChatDev) and in which field?\"\n*   **Plan B (Generated)** is organized around **methodological challenges and verification**. It is a process-driven plan that asks: \"What are the fundamental challenges of applying AI in different domains (e.g., physical priors, sim-to-real, human bias) and how do we validate the solutions?\"\n\nPlan B successfully maps all the content from Plan A onto its more analytical framework. It expands upon Plan A by providing a deeper, more systematic analysis of the *underlying reasons* for the differences between domains and by placing a much stronger emphasis on how to measure, verify, and validate AI-driven scientific outcomes. The generated plan is less a survey of specific projects and more a thesis on the comparative epistemology of AI-assisted science across disciplines."
