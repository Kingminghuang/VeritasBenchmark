    "evaluation_report": "I. Overall Conclusion  \nPlan B partially covers the research points laid out in Plan A. It reproduces the same three-stage framework (Pre-, In-, Post-Review) and touches on most high-level objectives, but it omits or treats only superficially many of the concrete, technical, and evaluative details specified in Plan A—especially the named systems, algorithmic mechanisms, metric-based comparisons, and benchmark discussion.\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A (Conceptual framework with three stages):  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (1) is explicitly organized into Pre-Review, In-Review, and Post-Review subsections and frames AI’s role in each, thereby satisfying the requirement to “define the core thesis … based on the three primary stages.” Although Plan B phrases the thesis as an “evolution” rather than a “clear conceptual framework,” the structural correspondence is complete.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A (Survey & categorize existing AI tools and models in each stage):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Pre-Review: Plan B lists “Automation of desk reviews,” “AI-powered reviewer matching,” and “Ethics and compliance checking,” which map to Plan A’s desk review and reviewer-matching categories. However, it does not name concrete systems such as Evise, AnnotateGPT, LCM, or latent topic models.  \n    – In-Review: Plan B’s “Single-agent,” “Iterative,” and “Multi-agent” systems align with peer-review generation paradigms, but meta-review synthesis tools (MetaWriter, PeerArg) and contradiction detection (ContraSciView) are missing.  \n    – Post-Review: “Predicting scholarly influence” and “Enhancing discoverability” parallel Plan A’s influence analysis and promotion enhancement, but again no specific methods (e.g., HLM-Cite, P2P, SciTalk) are cited.  \n    Thus, categorization is present in broad strokes, but the concrete inventory of current applications is largely absent.\n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A (Deep technical mechanism analysis):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    a. Reviewer matching—Plan B mentions reviewer matching but offers no discussion of expertise modeling, load balancing, or COI detection.  \n    b. Peer-review generation—Plan B does spell out “Single-agent,” “Iterative,” and “Multi-agent” systems, mirroring Plan A’s three optimization paradigms; however, it stays descriptive and does not delve into optimization algorithms or architectures.  \n    c. Meta-review generation—Plan B is silent on argument extraction, synthesis, or conflict modeling.  \n    Technical depth therefore falls short except for a surface acknowledgment of the peer-review generation paradigms.\n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A (Comparative performance analysis):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B discusses “strengths” and “limitations” in multiple sections (e.g., 2(b), 2(c), 5(a)), but the coverage is thematic (e.g., “AI’s strength in identifying statistical errors”) rather than a systematic, criteria-based comparison (accuracy, efficiency, scalability) across individual approaches. Quantitative or benchmarked assessment is absent.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A (Effectiveness vs. systemic challenges):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B references reviewer workload relief, acceleration of timelines, and potential bias or fairness issues (Sections 4(d), 5(a), 5(c)), but it does not tie these explicitly to concrete evidence or particular AI systems, nor does it evaluate consistency of feedback or fairness in assignment with specific metrics or case data.\n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A (Frontier directions & open challenges):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Ethical/bias concerns, transparency, human-in-the-loop needs, and reasoning limitations appear in Plan B (Sections 5(c), 7(c), 6(a)). However, standardized benchmarks, robustness evaluation, and concrete research roadmaps receive no explicit mention. The discussion remains conceptual.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Specificity: Plan A demands concrete system names, algorithmic details, and benchmark-driven evaluations; Plan B supplies only high-level thematic categories and sociotechnical reflections.  \n2. Depth of Technical Analysis: Plan A requires architectural and algorithmic deep dives; Plan B provides mainly descriptive overviews with minimal technical granularity.  \n3. Evaluation Orientation: Plan A centers on empirical comparison of AI tools against performance metrics; Plan B foregrounds philosophical, ethical, and labor-division considerations, offering little quantitative assessment.  \n4. Frontier Outlook: Both acknowledge bias and human-AI collaboration, but Plan B omits calls for standardized benchmarks and concrete future research agendas emphasized by Plan A.\n\nIn short, Plan B captures the conceptual scaffold and broader implications but lacks much of the concrete, technical, and evaluative substance specified by Plan A."

Overall Conclusion  \nPlan B provides broad thematic coverage of most of the areas demanded in Plan A, but it does so at a higher level of abstraction and omits many of the fine-grained surveys, taxonomies, and implementation specifics that Plan A explicitly requires. Hence, overall coverage is “Partially Covered.”\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A (Define core concepts and five-stage framework):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B §1 (a)(i–ii) presents a “Conceptual Framework” and lists four stages (Idea Mining, Novelty Assessment, Theory Analysis, Scientific Experiment Conduction). It discusses “Full-Automatic Discovery” in the section title, but treats it as an overarching goal rather than the fifth explicit stage identified in Plan A. The epistemological discussion (§1 a iii) addresses “core concepts,” yet the required explicit definition of all five stages is incomplete.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A (Survey and categorize techniques per stage):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    a. Idea Mining taxonomy (internal LLM knowledge, external signals, collaborative models): Plan B notes “generator agents,” “knowledge graphs,” and human–AI collaboration (§2 b and §3), but never classifies methods along the three requested axes.  \n    b. Novelty Assessment (statistical vs. LLM-augmented vs. hybrid): Plan B briefly lists “Novelty assessment metrics” (§5 c i) and “logical consistency validation” (§2 a), yet omits the explicit taxonomy.  \n    c. Theory Analysis (claim formalization, RAG, theorem proving): Elements appear in §4 a (formal languages, neuro-symbolic reasoning) and §2 a ii–iii, but no explicit catalog of systems such as RAG pipelines or ATP suites.  \n    d. Experiment Conduction (design, pre-estimation, open- vs. closed-loop labs): Plan B mentions “empirical verification layer,” “uncertainty-aware experimental design” (§2 c iii), and “learning from experimental failures” (§4 b ii), but does not map the tool landscape or classify lab architectures. Overall, the requested survey depth is missing.\n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A (Deep analysis of implementation mechanisms):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B contains discussions on multi-agent roles (§2 b), feedback loops (§4 b i), and uncertainty tracking (§2 c), which satisfy part of the mechanism analysis. However, Plan A also demands details on prompting strategies, decoding parameters, and concrete feedback-loop instantiation—all absent in Plan B.\n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A (Compare strengths, limitations, trade-offs, human-AI vs. full automation):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B addresses “Inherent Tensions” (§1 b) and dedicates §3 to Human-AI collaboration, implicitly contrasting approaches. Yet it never provides a systematic comparative matrix covering originality, reproducibility, scalability, bias, etc., as explicitly requested by Plan A.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A (Evaluate integration maturity of end-to-end systems):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s §7 a (“Integrated Scientific Discovery Ecosystems”) and §2 a iv (integration mechanisms) acknowledge the need for end-to-end pipelines, but they propose future architectures rather than analyzing present-day maturity, rigor, interpretability, or validation practices. The concrete assessment sought by Plan A is missing.\n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A (Frontier research directions and future challenges):  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s entire §7 (“Future Research Directions and Grand Challenges”) directly addresses frontier directions, paradigm shifts, and long-term agendas, aligning well with Plan A’s expectations.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Granularity: Plan A demands detailed taxonomies, concrete tool surveys, and implementation-level examination; Plan B remains conceptual and architectural.  \n2. Stage Definition: Plan A explicitly treats “Full-Automatic Discovery” as a fifth operational stage; Plan B treats it as an aspirational umbrella.  \n3. Comparative Evaluation: Plan A calls for systematic trade-off analysis with specific criteria; Plan B offers only qualitative discussions.  \n4. Practical State-of-the-Art Assessment: Plan A requires evaluation of current system maturity; Plan B focuses on proposed designs and future visions.  \n5. Coverage Additions: Plan B introduces ethical, social, and disciplinary-adaptation sections not foregrounded in Plan A, widening scope but not compensating for missing technical depth.\n\nIn sum, Plan B is broader but shallower: it sketches architectures, ethics, and future outlooks, yet omits many targeted surveys and detailed mechanism analyses that Plan A specifies."

    "evaluation_report": "I. Overall Conclusion\nPartially covered.  Plan B acknowledges the existence of AI applications along the research lifecycle and briefly “maps” them, but it omits most of Plan A’s concrete, resource-focused tasks (comprehensive inventory, methodological dissection, side-by-side comparison).  It devotes the bulk of its space to meta-evaluation themes (tension between specialisation and holism, integrated evaluation frameworks) that do not appear in Plan A.  Consequently, only Point (1) is roughly covered; Points (2)–(5) are largely missing; Point (6) is touched only in a high-level, philosophical way.\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A: Define the five core stages of the scientific research lifecycle.\n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B, section (1)(a), lists five “lifecycle” slots: (i) literature comprehension & survey generation, (ii) experimental design & hypothesis formulation, (iii) data analysis & pattern recognition, (iv) scientific writing & communication, (v) peer-review & validation.  These correspond fairly well to Plan A’s five stages except that Plan A’s “Scientific Discovery” is broader than Plan B’s “data analysis & pattern recognition,” and Plan A’s “Scientific Comprehension” is confined to understanding whereas Plan B folds comprehension into literature analysis.  Plan B does not explicitly define or justify why these are the canonical stages, nor does it give formal definitions, so coverage is only partial.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A: Systematically survey and map datasets/benchmarks/tools to each stage.\n  • Coverage Status: Not Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B contains no catalogue of concrete resources such as ScienceQA, SurveyBench, ScienceAgentBench, Writefull, or PeerRead, nor any intention to build such a catalogue.  It mentions “AI tools” generically but never inventories specific datasets, benchmarks or their mapping.\n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A: In-depth methodological analysis of every identified resource (data sources, annotation, metrics, algorithms).\n  • Coverage Status: Not Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B does not speak of drilling down into the internals of individual datasets/benchmarks/tools.  Its analysis is at the level of evaluation philosophies (e.g., “benchmark overfitting,” “explainability requirements”) and does not promise resource-level dissection.\n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A: Comparative analysis of resources within each stage (scope, complexity, modality, accessibility).\n  • Coverage Status: Not Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: No comparative tables or criteria-based contrast are proposed in Plan B.  It focuses instead on designing “integrated evaluation frameworks,” which is different from comparing existing datasets or tools by concrete attributes.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A: Evaluate maturity and capability of AI applications across the lifecycle—from isolated functions to end-to-end automation.\n  • Coverage Status: Weak / Indirectly Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B repeatedly raises the “specialised excellence vs. holistic advancement” tension and proposes “nested evaluation models” and “capability-impact matrices.”  While this hints at judging maturity, it remains conceptual; there is no explicit plan to grade present-day resources on a maturity scale, nor to contrast isolated vs. integrated systems.  Coverage is therefore weak and indirect.\n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A: Summarise research gaps and propose future directions (evaluation of reasoning, integrity, autonomous AI scientist, stage integration).\n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B dedicates large portions (Sections 2, 3, 4, 8) to high-level gaps: benchmark overfitting, fragmentation, explainability, human-AI complementarity, need for integrated evaluation.  It also calls for “architectures for truly integrated scientific AI systems” and “new models of human-AI partnership,” which overlaps with Plan A’s demand for future directions.  However, Plan B does not explicitly discuss “academic integrity in the face of AI-generated content,” nor does it foreground evaluation of complex scientific reasoning as a distinct challenge, so the match is only partial.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences\n1. Focus: Plan A is resource-centric (datasets, benchmarks, tools) and empirical; Plan B is evaluation-framework-centric and conceptual.\n2. Granularity: Plan A requires concrete inventories and fine-grained methodological comparisons; Plan B stays at a strategic, philosophical level without naming specific resources.\n3. Objectives: Plan A aims to characterise present capabilities and gaps across five lifecycle stages; Plan B aims to resolve a perceived systemic tension through integrated evaluation frameworks.\n4. Methodology: Plan A emphasises taxonomising, mapping, benchmarking, and maturity assessment; Plan B emphasises epistemological analysis, policy considerations, and framework design.\nBecause of these divergences, Plan B only partially satisfies Plan A’s requirements, leaving most operational, data-driven components unaddressed."

Overall Conclusion  \nPlan B provides broad, thematically-aligned coverage of most topics in Plan A, but it does so at a higher level of abstraction and omits several specific requirements. Overall judgment: partially covered.\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B implicitly follows the two-stage pipeline by organising its outline into (1) “Related Work Retrieval” and (2) “Overview Report Generation,” but it never explicitly defines the term “AI for Academic Survey,” states the primary goal of automating literature reviews, or formally names the pipeline stages. Core-concept framing and definitions are therefore missing.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Mostly Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Semantic-Guided methods: covered in §1(b) “Semantic Approaches.”  \n    – Graph-Guided methods: covered in §1(c) “Graph-Guided Approaches,” mentioning citation networks, co-citation, knowledge graphs, GNNs.  \n    – LLM-Augmented methods: covered in §1(d) and §1(e) (BERT, DPR, RAG, multi-agent).  \n    – “Single-agent / deep research” sub-categories are not named explicitly, but multi-agent systems are; deep-research flavour is implicit in “self-improving retrieval” yet not singled out.  \n    – Extra material (keyword era) is included but does not harm alignment.\n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Research Roadmap Mapping: directly addressed in §2(b).  \n    – Section-level related-work generation (extractive vs generative): NOT discussed; Plan B jumps from “basic summaries” to “roadmap” without the intermediate, section-granular treatments.  \n    – Document-level survey generation: addressed in §2(e) “Autonomous Document-Level Surveys.”  \n    – The requested distinction between extractive and generative techniques is absent.\n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Not Covered / Very Limited  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B mentions “multi-agent systems” and “autonomous surveys” but never contrasts concrete agent-based frameworks (AutoSurvey, SurveyForge, STORM) with fine-tuned model families (Bio-SIEVE, OpenScholar) nor analyses their architectures, strengths, or weaknesses.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B alludes to benefits such as “precision improvements,” “quality filtering,” and “self-critical assessment” (§4 & §5) but does not systematically evaluate models against the explicit challenges named in Plan A (semantic relevance, logical coherence, large-scale synthesis). No comparative metrics or empirical evaluation strategy is offered.\n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Integration of retrieval and generation appears in §6(a) “Seamless integration …” and §6(b).  \n    – Autonomy and end-to-end agents are hinted at in “multi-agent retrieval systems” and future work.  \n    – Factual accuracy and citation fidelity are only vaguely gestured toward (“maintaining scholarly standards”) and not analysed in depth.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Explicitness: Plan A demands formal definitions, taxonomies, and named frameworks; Plan B provides thematic but implicit treatment, skipping formal definitions and concrete system names.  \n2. Granularity: Plan A distinguishes fine-grained levels (e.g., section-level extractive vs generative); Plan B aggregates these into broader categories, losing mid-level detail.  \n3. Comparative Evaluation: Plan A stresses architectural comparisons and challenge-focused evaluation; Plan B is largely descriptive and evolutionary, offering little systematic comparison or critical appraisal.  \n4. Specific References: Plan B omits the exemplar systems (AutoSurvey, SurveyForge, STORM, Bio-SIEVE, OpenScholar) required for framework comparison.  \n5. Perspective: Plan A is task-oriented (how to build/evaluate an AI survey system); Plan B is history-oriented (how capabilities evolved) and thus sidesteps some practical evaluation issues."

Overall Conclusion  \nPlan B provides broad and often sophisticated discussion that touches most of the themes in Plan A, but it does so with different terminology and emphasis. Coverage is therefore “partially covered.”  Every point in Plan A is at least mentioned in Plan B, yet several required details—especially precise conceptual definition, specific taxonomies for text/table/chart techniques, and explicit mention of long-context handling—are missing or only implicitly alluded to.\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\nRegarding Point (1) of Plan A (Definition of the core concept and its two domains)  \n• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B repeatedly uses the phrase “AI Scientific Comprehension,” but it never supplies a formal definition or explicitly states that the goal is to “accelerate AI4Research.” The two domains (textual vs. table/chart) are referenced in §(2) “Unstructured Scientific Text” vs. “Structured Tables/Charts,” yet Plan B does not clearly present this as the foundational bifurcation called for in Plan A. Therefore the conceptual framing is only implicit.\n\nRegarding Point (2) of Plan A (Survey and categorize textual-comprehension approaches)  \n• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis:  \n  – Semi-automatic categories: Plan B’s “External Augmentation Strategies” map to “Human-Guided” and “Tool-Augmented.”  \n  – Fully-automatic categories: Plan B’s “Internal Autonomy Strategies” cover “Self-questioning” and “Emergent capabilities,” but the explicit “Summarization-guided” track is missing.  \n  – The precise tripartite semi-automatic subdivision (Human-Guided, Tool-Augmented, Self-guided) is not spelled out; Plan B merges “self-guided” into its autonomy section. Thus, only partial alignment.\n\nRegarding Point (3) of Plan A (Survey of table & chart comprehension techniques)  \n• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B recognises “Structured Tables and Charts Processing” (§2-b) and mentions “formalized representations,” “multi-modal integration,” and “visual understanding,” which relate to reasoning-structure and representation issues. However, it never lists concrete techniques such as “Data Augmentation,” “Chain-of-Table,” “FDV,” or dataset-creation practices. The requested enumeration of primary techniques is therefore incomplete.\n\nRegarding Point (4) of Plan A (Mechanistic analysis of each approach)  \n• Coverage Status: Largely Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis:  \n  – Tool-augmented systems: Plan B’s §1-a-ii (“tool-use and external knowledge integration,” “integration complexity”) mirrors the RAG + verification discussion.  \n  – Autonomous self-reflection: Plan B’s §1-b-i (“Self-questioning and reflective mechanisms”) directly corresponds.  \n  – Visual-data conversion: Plan B’s §5-d (“Multi-Modal Integration”) and §2-b lay out how text/visual data are unified.  \n  – The linkage is conceptually thorough, even though specific implementation names are not repeated.\n\nRegarding Point (5) of Plan A (Strength/limitation comparison of paradigms)  \n• Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B devotes §2 and §3 entirely to trade-off analyses—reliability, scalability, cost, inferential depth—matching Plan A’s requested comparison of semi-automatic vs. fully-automatic and of table/chart approaches. The criteria align almost one-for-one.\n\nRegarding Point (6) of Plan A (Frontier directions and challenges)  \n• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis:  \n  – Plan B §6 lists future directions such as evaluation frameworks, co-evolutionary learning, ethics, and agency balance, which fits “advanced autonomous reasoning frameworks” and “multimodal integration.”  \n  – Mitigating hallucinations is touched upon under “reduced hallucinations” and “confidence calibration.”  \n  – Long-context document performance, however, is never explicitly identified.  \n  – Dataset dependency issues for multimodal comprehension are likewise not directly articulated.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Conceptual Framing: Plan A begins with a crisp definition of the field and its bifurcation; Plan B dives directly into technique categories without first defining the domain.  \n2. Granularity of Technique Taxonomy: Plan A demands concrete, named methods (e.g., Chain-of-Table, FDV). Plan B speaks in higher-level abstractions (formalised representations, multi-modal integration) and omits the exemplars.  \n3. Explicit Future Challenges: Plan A highlights long-context reasoning and dataset dependency; Plan B stresses human-AI symbiosis, evaluation metrics, and ethical/agency issues instead.  \n4. Methodological Emphasis: Plan B is more systems-architecture-oriented (hybrid intelligence frameworks, dynamic autonomy) whereas Plan A is literature-survey-oriented, cataloguing specific approaches and datasets."

It reproduces the broad disciplinary partitioning and some comparative/forward-looking themes, but it omits most of the concrete model-level analyses, specific exemplars (e.g., AlphaFold, ChatDev, PINNs), and the explicit assessment of multi-agent LLM frameworks requested by Plan A. Coverage is therefore “partial”; several key items are either missing or treated at a much higher, less technical level.\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A (Core thesis of “AI for Science” and the role of ML, LLMs, multi-agent systems in automating research workflows):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (1) (“AI's Role Across Scientific Domains: Foundational Differences”) articulates an overarching view of how AI functions in the Natural, Applied and Social Sciences. However, it does not explicitly define “AI for Science” as a field, makes no direct mention of large-language-model (LLM) technology or multi-agent systems, and says little about the automation of full research workflows. Hence only a high-level conceptual framing is provided.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A (Survey & categorization of goals / application areas across physics, biology, chemistry, robotics, software engineering, sociology, psychology):  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (2) enumerates application areas in Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Robotics, Software Engineering, Sociology and Psychology that match Plan A’s roster. The description is concise but the presence of each area and its goal orientation satisfies the mapping requirement.\n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A (Deep model-level analysis in Natural Sciences: PINNs, AI-Newton, AlphaFold, DrugAgent, Clinical Brains, closed-loop materials platforms):  \n  • Coverage Status: Not Covered (Physics) / Not Covered (Biology & Medicine) / Not Covered (Chemistry & Materials)  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B lists topical themes (quantum simulation, genomics analysis, reaction optimisation, etc.) but never drills down to the named models (PINNs, AI-Newton, AlphaFold, DrugAgent, etc.) or explains their internal mechanisms. No discussion of closed-loop robotic labs is given. Thus the requested “deep analysis” is absent.\n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A (Detailed investigation in Applied & Social Sciences including end-to-end vision control, sim-to-real, ChatDev, social-simulation agents, MimiTalk, Therabot):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Applied Sciences: Plan B references “Autonomous navigation, manipulation, human-robot interaction” and acknowledges the “sim-to-real gap” (Section 3b), thereby touching vision-based control and sim-to-real transfer, but it omits the explicit example “ChatDev” and does not analyse software-development agents in depth.  \n    – Social Sciences: Plan B cites social-network analysis, policy simulation, mental-health assessment and behavior prediction, which align conceptually with Plan A’s social-simulation and psychological-intervention goals. Nonetheless, the concrete tool examples (MimiTalk, Therabot) and the specification of multi-agent LLM simulators are missing. Hence partial coverage.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A (Cross-field comparison of strengths, limitations, maturity; e.g., high accuracy in protein folding vs bias in social science):  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Sections (3) and (4) explicitly compare data characteristics, validation methodologies, and epistemological foundations, highlighting higher precision in Natural Sciences and bias/ethical issues in Social Sciences—directly mirroring Plan A’s requested comparison.\n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A (Evaluation of cross-cutting methodologies such as multi-agent systems and LLMs across tasks):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B notes “Physics-informed neural networks,” “human-in-the-loop systems,” and “Explainable AI,” but it does not overtly address multi-agent systems or LLMs as shared methodological backbones across domains. Therefore only a subset of the cross-cutting techniques is assessed.\n\n• Regarding Point (7) of Plan A (Frontier directions: fully automated research loops, human-AI collaboration, robustness/safety, ethics & bias):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (5) lists “hybrid approaches,” “human-in-the-loop,” “explainable AI,” transfer learning, and ethics-related transparency. These address collaboration, robustness, and ethics. However, it omits explicit discussion of fully autonomous research loops and the safety issues tied to sim-to-real robotics, leaving part of the frontier outlook uncovered.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Granularity: Plan A demands model-specific, mechanism-level detail; Plan B stays at a conceptual/disciplinary level and lacks concrete exemplars.  \n2. Methodological Emphasis: Plan A foregrounds LLMs and multi-agent systems as unifying technologies; Plan B mentions neither explicitly (LLMs only implicitly through code generation and mental-health chatbots).  \n3. Frontier Vision: Plan A stresses full research automation and safety; Plan B emphasises interdisciplinary collaboration and explainability, leaving automation aspects under-developed.  \n4. Example Diversity: Plan A uses named systems (AlphaFold, ChatDev, Therabot) for illustrative depth; Plan B uses generic category labels, resulting in shallower coverage."

Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (1) (“Conceptual Foundations of AI Paradigms in Academic Writing”) clearly distinguishes “semi-automatic” from “full automation,” discusses their historical evolution, underlying principles, and even philosophical assumptions—matching and extending the conceptual requirement of Plan A.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Phase structure: Plan B’s Section (2) mirrors the three phases (preparation, writing, revision) and discusses functions in each, so the overall taxonomy is present.  \n    – Missing concrete techniques & tools: Plan A explicitly calls for title-optimization models (PEGASUS-large), figure generators (FigGen), formula transcription (ViT-based models), citation recommenders (CiteBART, ScholarCopilot), and revision tools (XtraGPT, OverleafCopilot). Plan B lists none of these by name nor analyzes them.  \n    – Missing revision typology: Plan A differentiates self-guided, human-guided, and human-in-the-loop revision; Plan B only generically references “decision points for human intervention” without that fine subdivision.  \n    – Therefore, while the structural outline matches, the substance is incomplete.\n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (3) examines “Self-Refining, Multi-Agent Methodologies” and covers multi-agent architectures, shared memory, self-evaluation loops—meeting the mechanism focus. However, Plan A demands deep analysis of specific flagship systems (“AI Scientist,” “Agent Laboratory,” “Zochi”); Plan B only offers a generic “analysis of existing fully automated systems” without naming or detailing them. Hence only partial coverage.\n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (4) (“Fundamental Contrasts in Human Oversight Requirements”) directly addresses manuscript quality, oversight, accountability, efficiency, and ethical/legal dimensions—precisely the comparative evaluation sought in Plan A.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (5)(a) devotes three sub-points to “Citation and reference management challenges,” explicitly treating accuracy, verification, contextual relevance, and integration of references. Although it does not separate the two paradigms in different sub-sections, the general evaluation criterion is met.\n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (6) (“Implications for the Future of Scholarly Manuscript Creation”) canvasses reliability of full automation, enhancement of human-AI collaboration, hybrid models, and policy trajectories—covering exactly the frontier directions and challenges enumerated in Plan A.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Specificity vs. Generality: Plan A is exemplar-driven, repeatedly anchoring discussion in named systems and models; Plan B remains largely theoretical and omits virtually all concrete examples.  \n2. Depth of Tool-Level Analysis: Plan A demands fine technical detail (model families, agent laboratories, revision taxonomies). Plan B presents architectural or functional overviews without drilling into implementation specifics.  \n3. Additional Philosophical/Ethical Scope: Plan B introduces philosophical, epistemological, legal, and disciplinary-culture perspectives that go beyond Plan A’s requirements.  \n4. Revision Taxonomy Gap: Plan A’s explicit self-guided/human-guided/human-in-the-loop distinction is absent from Plan B.  \n5. Citation Focus: Both address citation problems, but Plan B treats them generically rather than by paradigm, while still satisfying coverage.\n\nConsequently, Plan B offers a broader, more conceptual roadmap but lacks the granular, example-rich treatment mandated in Plan A."

    "evaluation_report": "I. Overall Conclusion  \nPlan B partially covers the research points laid out in Plan A. It addresses most of the thematic frontiers (interdisciplinary work, ethics/safety, collaboration, explainability, multimodal & multilingual integration) and discusses several trade-offs. However, it treats real-time/agentic experimentation only tangentially, omits many concrete techniques that Plan A explicitly requires (e.g., graph models, white-box circuit analysis, self-driving-lab architectures), and rarely analyzes implementation details to the depth demanded. Consequently, several sub-requirements of Plan A are either missing or handled only at a high conceptual level.\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A – Definition of seven key frontiers  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Interdisciplinary models ⇒ Plan B (1A) “Interdisciplinary Data Integration Frameworks”.  \n    – Ethics & safety ⇒ Plan B (2A) “Ethical Integrity Requirements”.  \n    – Collaborative research ⇒ Plan B (2C) “Human-AI Collaboration Requirements”.  \n    – Explainability ⇒ Plan B (2B) “Causal Explainability Demands”.  \n    – Multimodal & multilingual ⇒ Plan B (1B) and (1C).  \n    – Real-time experimentation/frontier is virtually absent; only a brief phrase “real-time experimental collaboration interfaces” (2C-v) appears, without any dedicated frontier discussion.  \n    – Plan A’s explicit “seven” frontiers shrink to six in Plan B, with real-time experimentation largely missing.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A – Survey of mainstream techniques per frontier  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    a. Interdisciplinary AI: Plan A asks for “Foundation Models and Graph Models”. Plan B mentions “core foundation models” (5C-i) but never cites graph modeling.  \n    b. Ethics & Safety: Plan A lists “Fairness-Aware Training, Training-Free Debiasing, ethical monitoring benchmarks”. Plan B offers generic “bias detection and mitigation strategies” (2A-ii) and “responsible AI governance” but no explicit training-free debiasing or benchmark catalogue.  \n    c. Collaborative Research: Plan A requires “Collaborative AI Agents and Federated Learning”. Plan B does discuss “knowledge co-creation” (2C-ii) and a full subsection on “Federated Architectural Approaches” (4B). Collaborative agents are implied but not enumerated.  \n    d. Explainability: Plan A distinguishes white-box (circuit) vs black-box (I/O) analysis. Plan B speaks of “causal inference” and “model interpretability” but never separates white- vs black-box nor mentions circuit-level analysis.  \n    e. Real-Time Experimentation: Plan A names “Agentic Real-Time AI” and “Self-driving Laboratory systems”. Plan B only provides “real-time experimental collaboration interfaces” without surveying concrete agentic or laboratory systems.  \n    f. Multimodal & Multilingual Integration: Plan A expects data-pipeline, HITL, terminology alignment, performance equilibration. Plan B covers “unified representation learning”, “quality assessment”, and “terminology alignment” (1B-iv, 1C-iv) but omits explicit pipeline engineering and performance-equilibration techniques.\n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A – Deep analysis of implementation mechanisms  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    a. Handling heterogeneous data & cross-domain transfer ⇒ briefly in Plan B (1A-i/ii, 1B-iii) but without mechanism detail.  \n    b. Debiasing mechanics & ethical regulation ⇒ Plan B notes “bias detection and mitigation strategies” (2A-ii) but no algorithmic deep dive.  \n    c. Human-AI interaction protocols & federated training process ⇒ Plan B touches on “interactive workflows” (2C-i) and federated pros/cons (4B), yet lacks protocol or gradient-sharing specifics.  \n    d. White-box circuit linkage vs black-box behavior inference ⇒ absent.  \n    e. Closed-loop robotics/instrument architectures ⇒ missing; only high-level “real-time interfaces” mention.\n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A – Comparison of strengths, limitations & trade-offs  \n  • Coverage Status: Mostly Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    a. Performance vs fairness trade-off appears in Plan B (3A).  \n    b. Transparency vs performance trade-off is expressed as “Explainability vs Model Complexity” (3B).  \n    c. Data privacy vs accessibility conflict is mirrored by “Privacy preservation vs knowledge sharing” (3A-ii) and federated advantages/disadvantages (4B).  \n    d. Capacity vs coverage in multilingual models is not explicitly discussed. Additional tensions (automation vs oversight, sustainability, etc.) are extra but do not replace the missing multilingual trade-off.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A – Evaluation of present capabilities against challenges  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    a. Negative transfer mitigation: not evaluated.  \n    b. Plagiarism singularity & dichotomous mania: plagiarism is acknowledged (2A-iv), dichotomous mania absent; no effectiveness evaluation.  \n    c. Low-latency decision-making in self-driving labs: not assessed.  \n    d. Cross-modal data scarcity & uncertainty quantification: uncertainty quantification noted (2B-iii) but no assessment; data scarcity challenge is not evaluated.\n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A – Synthesis of future directions & open questions  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    a. Standardized frameworks/metrics for explainability & fairness: implied via “verification standards” (2B-v) and “success metrics” (5D-v) but not elaborated.  \n    b. High-quality aligned multimodal/multilingual datasets: not explicitly targeted.  \n    c. Robust human-AI interaction models: addressed conceptually in (2C) and roadmap (5C-iii).  \n    d. Low-latency hardware-software integration for self-driving labs: missing.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Depth vs Breadth: Plan A specifies concrete technologies and requires detailed mechanistic analysis; Plan B remains high-level, policy-oriented, and architectural, rarely naming specific algorithms or implementation details.  \n2. Real-Time Experimentation: Plan A treats agentic real-time experimentation and self-driving labs as a full frontier; Plan B only mentions real-time interfaces in passing.  \n3. Technique Granularity: Plan A differentiates white-box vs black-box explainability, foundation vs graph models, etc.; Plan B aggregates under broader headings (e.g., “causal explainability”) without such granularity.  \n4. Evaluation Focus: Plan A demands explicit capability assessments (negative transfer, latency, data scarcity); Plan B lists challenges and tensions but offers little evaluative content.  \n5. Future-Work Emphasis: Plan B expands on governance, sustainability, and architectural styles, topics that Plan A does not foreground, reflecting a somewhat different perspective on AI4Research development."
