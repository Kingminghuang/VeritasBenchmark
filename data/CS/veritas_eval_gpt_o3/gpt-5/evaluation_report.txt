Total points evaluated: 6

Fully Covered       : 3 / 6 (50.00%)

Not Covered         : 0 / 6 (0.00%)
I. Overall Conclusion  
Plan B provides broad, largely aligned coverage of the six research foci laid out in Plan A, but several elements are only partially addressed and a few are missing entirely. The main gaps are:  
• insufficient listing of concrete, existing AI systems (Plan A’s named tools),  
• lack of detailed discussion of load-balancing algorithms in reviewer matching, contradiction-detection systems during review, and argument-extraction techniques for meta-reviews,  
• limited treatment of the optimisation paradigms that drive AI-generated reviews.  
Hence, coverage is best characterised as “partially covered”.

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  

Regarding Point (1) of Plan A (Conceptual framework with Pre-/In-/Post-Review stages):  
• Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s section 1.1 explicitly “clarifies the three AI involvement stages” and mirrors exactly the Pre-, In-, Post-Review structure. It also states benefits/risks and normative axes, thereby establishing a conceptual thesis about AI integration.

Regarding Point (2) of Plan A (Survey and categorisation of current applications)  
• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis:  
  – Plan B’s section 2 provides a taxonomy for each stage and names categories that match Plan A (desk review, reviewer matching, AI-generated reviews, meta-review synthesis, impact prediction, promotion).  
  – Missing or weak:  
    • No explicit mention of the concrete tools Evise, AnnotateGPT, LCM, AgentReview, TreeReview, MetaWriter, PeerArg, ContraSciView, HLM-Cite, P2P, SciTalk.  
    • Contradiction-detection systems (ContraSciView) are not singled out.  
    • Influence-analysis tools are subsumed under “impact prediction” without naming examples.

Regarding Point (3) of Plan A (Deep technical mechanism analysis)  
• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis:  
  a. Reviewer matching: Plan B (2.1b) covers expertise embeddings, topic graphs, COI detection—matching two of the three sub-items—but omits explicit load-balancing strategies.  
  b. Peer-review generation paradigms: Plan B (2.2a) lists “single-agent automated reviews; iterative co-authoring; multi-agent debate”, aligning with Plan A’s three paradigms. However it offers no deeper architectural or optimisation discussion.  
  c. Meta-review generation: Plan B notes “meta-review aggregation” and “argument consistency checks” (3.1d) but gives no detail on argument extraction techniques or modelling conflicting viewpoints.  

Regarding Point (4) of Plan A (Comparative analysis of approaches by accuracy, efficiency, quality, scalability)  
• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B implicitly compares approaches through “pressure points”, “quality criteria”, and proposed RCT/benchmark methods (sections 2, 3, 6, 7), but it does not present an explicit side-by-side strengths/limitations matrix for each AI category.

Regarding Point (5) of Plan A (Evaluate effectiveness on systemic challenges)  
• Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s sections 1.3a (benefits), 2 (pressure points), and 6–7 (RCTs, metrics) repeatedly target workload reduction, delay minimisation, quality consistency, and fairness in manuscript assignment.

Regarding Point (6) of Plan A (Frontier directions and open challenges)  
• Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B extensively identifies bias, reasoning limitations, human-in-the-loop, benchmark creation, security, governance, and policy issues (sections 1.3b, 3.2, 7.4, 8, 9). These align with or go beyond Plan A’s listed open challenges.

III. Summary of Core Differences  
1. Specificity vs Generality: Plan A inventories concrete existing systems; Plan B deliberately opts for category-level discussion, omitting most named exemplars.  
2. Technical Depth: Plan A demands granular algorithmic/architectural analysis (e.g., optimisation paradigms, argument extraction). Plan B mentions these topics but rarely drills into mechanism-level detail.  
3. Additional Dimensions: Plan B broadens scope to include governance, policy, accountability, quality re-definition, and labour division—areas outside Plan A’s core list.  
4. Comparative Evaluation: Plan A calls for systematic performance comparison; Plan B proposes experimental designs but does not yet deliver the comparative synthesis.  

In short, Plan B captures all headline themes of Plan A, but with notable omissions in concrete tool surveying and certain technical deep-dives, while simultaneously adding broader normative and governance perspectives.

Partially Covered   : 4 / 6 (66.67%)
Not Covered         : 0 / 6 (0.00%)
I. Overall Conclusion  
Partially covered – Plan B addresses most technical points raised in Plan A and, in several places, goes into even greater engineering detail. However, it omits or only lightly touches on some requirements, most notably (a) treating “Full-Automatic Discovery” as its own explicit stage, (b) providing a literature-style survey/classification of existing methods (it offers an architecture proposal instead), (c) systematically comparing strengths/limitations of alternative approaches, and (d) explicitly summarising frontier research gaps and future challenges.

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  

• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A: Define core concepts and five-stage framework (Idea Mining, Novelty & Significance, Theory Analysis, Experiment, Full-Automatic Discovery).  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B §1(a) lists four stages that match the first four in Plan A but does not label “Full-Automatic Discovery” as a distinct stage; instead it treats full automation as an overall goal. The conceptual definitions of each listed stage are present, but the formal recognition and framing of a fifth stage are missing.

• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A: Survey and categorise mainstream techniques per stage.  
  • Coverage Status: Mostly but not fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis:  
    a. Idea Mining – Plan B’s “Creative Generator” (LLM ensemble with temperature schedules), RAG layer, self-critique, and Human-AI “Copilot” roles correspond to internal-knowledge, external-signal and collaborative categories, satisfying sub-point (a).  
    b. Novelty Assessment – Plan B §4 gives literature mining, semantic divergence metrics, and human review, matching sub-point (b).  
    c. Theory Analysis – Plan B §3 & §5 describe formalisation, theorem-prover checks, causal DAGs, etc., aligning with sub-point (c).  
    d. Experiment Conduction – Plan B §6 maps tools for OED, automation, QC, closed-loop replication. It implicitly covers open vs closed-loop labs (adaptive designs, active learning) but does not explicitly classify them.  
    Remaining gap: Plan A asks for a survey/“listing and classifying key approaches”; Plan B mostly proposes an architecture rather than enumerating extant methods/literature.

• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A: Deep implementation analysis (prompting, decoding, multi-agent debate, feedback loops).  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B §3 contains constrained decoding, ensemble sampling, self-critique, debate, SMT checks and feedback-loop tuning—exactly the mechanisms requested.

• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A: Compare strengths/limitations and trade-offs (automation vs Human-AI; originality, reproducibility, bias).  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B introduces “Copilot vs Autopilot,” risk-tier gating, metrics for discovery yield and reproducibility, and bias-mitigation modules, but it does not explicitly juxtapose different families of existing systems or articulate detailed pros/cons; comparison remains implicit.

• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A: Evaluate integration maturity, end-to-end capability, challenges in combining stages.  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s layered architecture, governance spine, and implementation roadmap examine how pieces fit together, but they present a proposed system rather than evaluating maturity of current real-world systems. Discussion of challenges (e.g., risk analysis, provenance) is present, yet maturity assessment of existing pipelines is minimal.

• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A: Summarise frontier research directions and future challenges.  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s “Risk analysis,” “Case studies,” and “Implementation roadmap” hint at future milestones and escalate to wet labs, but it lacks an explicit, high-level synthesis of research gaps or visionary challenges for “self-driving laboratories.”

III. Summary of Core Differences  

1. Perspective: Plan A is principally a survey/assessment document; Plan B is an engineering blueprint that specifies how to build a comprehensive system.  
2. Stage Definition: Plan A treats “Full-Automatic Discovery” as a discrete fifth stage; Plan B weaves full automation throughout without defining it as a stage.  
3. Literature Coverage: Plan A demands cataloguing existing techniques; Plan B emphasises architectural components and does not systematically review prior work.  
4. Comparative Evaluation: Plan A calls for explicit strengths/weaknesses comparisons; Plan B embeds metrics and risk controls but supplies limited comparative analysis.  
5. Forward-Looking Synthesis: Plan A expects a concise statement of frontier challenges; Plan B provides a roadmap but no dedicated section distilling open research questions.

Consequently, Plan B offers rich technical depth and practical design details but only partially fulfills the scholarly survey and comparative mandates laid out in Plan A.

    Quantitative Coverage Analysis (9.json)
==========================================================================================

Total points evaluated: 6

Fully Covered       : 3 / 6 (50.00%)
Partially Covered   : 3 / 6 (50.00%)
Not Covered         : 0 / 6 (0.00%)
I. Overall Conclusion  
Plan B covers most high-level intentions of Plan A but does so from a broader, systems-engineering perspective. All six Plan A points are at least mentioned, yet points (2), (3), and (4) are only partially satisfied because Plan B does not promise a concrete, itemised inventory of existing datasets/benchmarks/tools nor a fine-grained, side-by-side comparison of them. Instead it emphasises taxonomies, generic critiques, and new integrated evaluation frameworks. Therefore, coverage is “partially covered.”

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  

• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A (define the five lifecycle stages)  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered (with extension)  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B section 1(a) lists comprehension/survey, hypothesis generation, experimental design, execution, analysis, writing, peer review, replication, and impact. This subsumes Plan A’s five stages (comprehension, survey generation, discovery, writing, peer review) and further adds several extra phases. Hence the point is covered, albeit with a finer granularity.

• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A (inventory and mapping of concrete resources)  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B section 2(a) promises to “taxonomize datasets/benchmarks by lifecycle stage,” and 2(c) to “identify tooling ecosystems.” However, it never commits to or exemplifies a concrete catalogue like “ScienceQA, SurveyBench, ScienceAgentBench, Writefull, PeerRead” mapped to stages. Thus the mapping intent is acknowledged but not fully implemented.

• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A (in-depth methodology/design analysis of each resource)  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B section 2(b) discusses “typical evaluation signals per stage,” and 3(a-h) critiques methodological issues (proxy metrics, data contamination, etc.). Yet it addresses these aspects generically at the stage level rather than resource-by-resource. No plan to inspect individual dataset annotation pipelines, benchmark task formats, or tool architectures is stated.

• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A (comparative analysis within each stage across criteria)  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B section 2(d) “summarize progress patterns and constraints” and 9(a-c) “correlational studies… ablate sub-capabilities.” These propose comparative evaluation, but again at an aggregate or meta-benchmark level. Explicit criteria such as scope, task complexity, modality, and accessibility are implicit—e.g., 2(b) mentions “limitations,” and 5(d) introduces budget/safety constraints—but no explicit, per-resource matrix is promised.

• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A (evaluate maturity/capability from isolated tools to end-to-end automation)  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B tackles this extensively: section 4(c) defines autonomy levels (assistant → fully autonomous), section 5 introduces “closed-loop, longitudinal discovery challenges,” and 9 maps siloed performance to integrated outcomes. This goes beyond Plan A’s requested maturity assessment.

• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A (identify research gaps and future directions)  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B devotes sections 3 (fundamental tensions), 5–6 (integrated frameworks and metrics), 10 (anti-gaming), 11 (ethical/legal/social), and 12 (roadmap) to precisely these gaps and future work. Issues such as complex reasoning evaluation, academic integrity (addressed via provenance audits and IP/authorship discussion), autonomous “AI scientists,” and tool integration are all present.

III. Summary of Core Differences  
1. Granularity and Perspective: Plan A focuses on a concrete survey of existing resources, whereas Plan B emphasizes system-level taxonomies and new evaluation infrastructure, giving less attention to detailed cataloguing.  
2. Methodological Emphasis: Plan A requires micro-level analysis (per dataset/benchmark/tool); Plan B concentrates on macro-level shortcomings (proxy-metric gaps, Goodhart effects) and proposes new composite benchmarks.  
3. Scope Expansion: Plan B broadens the lifecycle (adds hypothesis, design, execution, replication, impact) and introduces governance, safety, and ethical considerations not explicit in Plan A.  
4. Deliverables: Plan A expects an inventory and comparative tables; Plan B promises frameworks, simulators, governance structures, and pilot challenges.  
5. Missing Specificity: Plan B omits the explicit, named resource mapping and per-resource methodological deep dive that are central to Plan A points (2)–(4).

In short, Plan B is more ambitious and systemic but only partially fulfils Plan A’s concrete survey and comparative requirements.

Partially Covered   : 4 / 6 (66.67%)
Not Covered         : 0 / 6 (0.00%)
I. Overall Conclusion  
Plan B covers most of the conceptual territory laid out in Plan A, but coverage is uneven.  Points (1) and (2) are fully addressed; points (3), (4), (5), and (6) are only partially covered—mainly because Plan B omits certain explicit distinctions or named systems that Plan A requires and provides less direct, systematic comparison of strengths/weaknesses.  Overall verdict: Partially Covered.

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  

• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A: Investigate and define core concepts and the two-stage pipeline  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (1) explicitly frames the two stages “Related Work Retrieval (RWR)” and “Overview Report Generation (ORG)” and states the central inquiry, matching Plan A’s definition. Stage objectives, outputs, and their interdependence are clearly enumerated—hence full alignment.

• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A: Paradigms for the Related Work Retrieval stage  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Sections (2)(a)–(2)(d) and detailed evolution in Section (3) map one-to-one to:  
      – Semantic-Guided (Plan B: “semantic retrieval” with dense embeddings, hybrid fusion).  
      – Graph-Guided (Plan B: “graph-guided retrieval” with citation/co-citation networks, heterogeneous GNNs).  
      – LLM-Augmented (Plan B: “LLM-augmented retrieval”) and explicit “multi-agent retrieval systems,” which corresponds to Plan A’s single-agent, multi-agent, deep-research taxonomy.  Mechanistic details are supplied, satisfying this point.

• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A: Automation levels in Overview Report Generation  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B distinguishes roadmap mapping, section-level synthesis, and document-level surveys (Sections (1)(b), (4)(a–d)).  However, it never explicitly contrasts “extractive vs. generative” methods at the section level, nor does it formally label “Research Roadmap Mapping” as a separate automation level; instead, it embeds it as an artifact.  Hence the major tiers exist, but the extractive/generative dichotomy and formal taxonomy are missing.

• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A: Comparative critique of agent-based vs fine-tuned document-level survey frameworks (AutoSurvey, SurveyForge, STORM vs Bio-SIEVE, OpenScholar)  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B discusses “multi-agent → autonomous document-level surveys” (Section (4)(d)) and names general architectures (planner/writer/verifier). Yet it does not cite or analyse the specific agent frameworks or contrast them with fine-tuning-based systems. Fine-tuned models (Bio-SIEVE, OpenScholar) are absent; no strengths/limitations table is offered.

• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A: Evaluation of retrieval and generation models against core challenges  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B dedicates Section (7) to evaluation, listing metrics for semantic relevance, citation correctness, factual consistency, coherence, etc.  Nevertheless, it lacks a qualitative discussion that ties particular retrieval/generation approaches to how well they mitigate each challenge, as Plan A asks.  The challenge/solution analysis is implied but not explicitly argued.

• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A: Frontier research directions and future challenges  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Sections (8) (progressive pipeline studies), (9) (reliability/ethics), and repeated emphasis on multi-agent autonomy implicitly cover “end-to-end research agents,” better retrieval-generation integration, and factual correctness.  However, it does not culminate in a concise forward-looking summary; nor does it explicitly label “Deep Research” or forecast novel directions beyond those already enumerated.

III. Summary of Core Differences  

1. Specificity of Examples: Plan A grounds comparisons in named systems (AutoSurvey, SurveyForge, Bio-SIEVE, etc.); Plan B uses generic architectural descriptions and omits most concrete system names.  
2. Taxonomic Precision: Plan A draws clear boundaries (e.g., extractive vs. generative section-level generation) that Plan B only alludes to.  
3. Comparative Depth: Plan B excels at enumerating mechanisms and proposing evaluation protocols, but offers less side-by-side critique of strengths/limitations demanded by Plan A.  
4. Future Outlook: Plan B weaves forward-looking elements throughout but lacks a dedicated, synthesized “frontier directions” section.  

Therefore, while Plan B is conceptually comprehensive, it requires additional explicit distinctions, named framework comparisons, and synthesized future-research commentary to fully meet every point in Plan A.

Partially Covered   : 3 / 6 (50.00%)
Not Covered         : 0 / 6 (0.00%)
I. Overall Conclusion  
Plan B covers nearly all of the conceptual ground laid out in Plan A, but several items are only partially addressed and a few specific details are missing. The coverage can therefore be classified as “largely—but not fully—covered.” Plan B reorganises the material around a “strategy (External vs Internal) × modality (Text vs Tables/Charts)” matrix. While this framing subsumes most points in Plan A, it occasionally glosses over concrete sub-categories (e.g., the three semi-automatic textual methods in Plan A) and omits some explicit future-direction items.

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  

Regarding Point (1) of Plan A: Definition and dual domains of AI for Scientific Comprehension  
• Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis: Section (1) of Plan B explicitly “Clarify scope, definitions, and objectives,” defining two strategies (external vs internal) and two modalities—“unstructured scientific text” and “structured artifacts: tables / charts.” This matches Plan A’s insistence on defining the concept and its two primary domains (textual vs table/chart comprehension). Plan B also situates the concept within AI4Research by stating the goal of “genuine scientific synthesis,” which aligns with Plan A’s framing of accelerating AI4Research.

Regarding Point (2) of Plan A: Detailed taxonomy of textual comprehension approaches (Human-Guided, Tool-Augmented, Self-guided vs Summarisation-guided, Self-Questioning)  
• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis:  
  – Plan B’s “External augmentation” corresponds to Human-Guided and Tool-Augmented; “Internal autonomy” covers Self-guiding/Self-Questioning.  
  – However, Plan B does not explicitly enumerate the three distinct semi-automatic subclasses (Human-Guided, Tool-Augmented, Self-Guided) nor the two distinct fully-automatic subclasses (Summarisation-Guided vs Self-Questioning). “Summarisation-guided” is not singled out anywhere. Therefore coverage is conceptual but not as granular.

Regarding Point (3) of Plan A: Techniques for table and chart comprehension (table augmentation, reasoning paradigms like Chain-of-Table; chart dataset development, structured representations like FDV)  
• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis:  
  – Plan B’s Sections (2b-c), (3b-c), and (4b-c) discuss parser pipelines, SQL/program synthesis, unit normalisation, chart-to-data extraction, axis/scale parsing, etc.—capturing most practical techniques.  
  – It references datasets (PubTables-1M, ChartQA, etc.), meeting the “dataset development” aspect.  
  – Yet Plan B does not explicitly mention the “Chain-of-Table” reasoning paradigm or the FDV structured representation; these are examples cited in Plan A that remain unnamed in Plan B. Hence only partial coverage.

Regarding Point (4) of Plan A: Analysis of core implementation mechanisms (tool integration with RAG, verification, self-reflection, visual-to-text conversion)  
• Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis:  
  – Section (3a) discusses RAG with citation control and verifiers; (3) & (4) outline reliability trade-offs, self-reflection, self-consistency, and meta-reasoning; (6a-b) detail PDF parsing, chart-to-data, and unit normalisation—directly mapping to Plan A’s requested mechanism analysis.

Regarding Point (5) of Plan A: Comparative evaluation of strengths/limitations (reliability, cost, scalability, dataset dependency, reasoning structures)  
• Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis:  
  – Plan B’s 2×2×3 trade-off matrix (Sections 3–5) explicitly evaluates reliability, scalability, and inferential depth across strategies and modalities; this precisely fulfils Plan A’s comparative requirement.  
  – It also covers dataset dependence (parser brittleness, schema drift) and reasoning structures (tool vs autonomy).

Regarding Point (6) of Plan A: Frontier directions and challenges (long-context, multimodal integration, hallucinations, advanced reasoning)  
• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
• Rationale and Analysis:  
  – Plan B lists “Challenges: long-range discourse,” “multimodal,” “hallucinated synthesis,” and proposes a hybrid router and uncertainty-aware verifiers—thereby touching on long-context handling, multimodal fusion, and hallucination mitigation.  
  – Future-looking research directions are implicit (e.g., “distill tool-augmented traces,” “continuous evaluation”), but Plan A calls for an explicit “frontier research agenda,” which Plan B does not systematically enumerate beyond its risk/mitigation list. Hence partial.

III. Summary of Core Differences  
1. Framing: Plan A uses a method-centric taxonomy (semi-automatic vs fully-automatic for text; specific named paradigms for tables/charts). Plan B reframes everything into a high-level Strategy × Modality matrix, sacrificing some of the fine-grained categories present in Plan A.  
2. Specific Examples: Plan A names exemplar paradigms (Summarisation-guided, Chain-of-Table, FDV). Plan B covers the general ideas but omits these labels and associated nuances.  
3. Future Outlook: Plan A explicitly calls for an itemised frontier research roadmap; Plan B embeds challenges, risks, and mitigations throughout but lacks a dedicated forward-looking section.  
4. Depth vs Breadth: Plan B provides a broader systems and evaluation perspective (tools, team roles, milestones) that Plan A does not request, but this does not compensate for the missing granularity in certain method categories.

Not Covered         : 0 / 7 (0.00%)
I. Overall Conclusion  
Plan B covers the majority of the research points laid out in Plan A, but coverage is only partial. While the overall scope, domain breakdown, and comparative/forward-looking components are well addressed, Plan B omits or only briefly alludes to several concrete exemplars, especially those that feature (i) large-language-model (LLM) or explicitly multi-agent–based systems (e.g., AI-Newton, DrugAgent, ChatDev, MimiTalk, Therabot) and (ii) domain-specific landmark systems such as AlphaFold. Hence, Plan B is best characterized as “partially covered.”

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  

• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A: Core thesis definition (AI technologies, roles, automation, discovery, insight)  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s section (1)(a) explicitly enumerates “workflow automation, discovery acceleration, novel insight generation” as AI roles. Although the wording differs, the substance matches. References to “model classes … human-in-the-loop” and an outline that begins with “Define scope and comparison axes” collectively establish the requested foundational perspective.

• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A: High-level survey/map of goals and application areas across Physics, Biology/Medicine, Chemistry, Robotics, Software Engineering, Sociology, Psychology  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s section (1)(b) lists Natural, Applied, and Social Science domains exactly matching Plan A’s taxonomy. Sections (3)–(5) then devote dedicated sub-sections to Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Robotics, Software Engineering, as well as “Sociology and psychology.” Thus the requested survey and categorization are present.

• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A: Natural-Science deep dives with specific system exemplars  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis:  
    – Physics: Plan B mentions “physics-informed NNs, equivariant/symplectic models,” satisfying the PINN requirement, but never references LLM-based law-discovery systems like AI-Newton.  
    – Biology/Medicine: It discusses “structure/function prediction … automated wet-lab workflows” but omits explicit system-level exemplars (AlphaFold, DrugAgent, ‘Clinical Brain’ LLMs).  
    – Chemistry/Materials: “Closed-loop lab automation” is covered, matching Plan A.  
    Missing concrete LLM/multi-agent exemplars render coverage only partial.

• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A: Applied & Social-Science deep dives with exemplar systems  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis:  
    – Robotics: Plan B thoroughly addresses sim-to-real, perception, planning, control; end-to-end vision control is implicitly included.  
    – Software Engineering: Roles such as code generation, test synthesis, CI/CD appear, but the exemplar “ChatDev” is not cited.  
    – Social Sciences: Plan B discusses “agent-based simulations” and “survey design,” satisfying the simulation aspect. However, specific AI-assisted interview systems (MimiTalk) and therapeutic chatbots (Therabot) are absent.  

• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A: Cross-field comparison of strengths, limitations, maturity, predictive reliability  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s section (6) “Thematic comparison” directly contrasts physical vs social domains on priors, feedback speed, ground-truth clarity, and reliability—mirroring the requested disparities such as protein-folding accuracy versus bias in social prediction.

• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A: Evaluation of cross-cutting methodologies (LLMs, multi-agent systems) across diverse tasks  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B discusses “model classes (symbolic, mechanistic, neural, hybrid)” and repeatedly references “human-in-the-loop,” “agent-based simulations,” and “closed-loop decision-making,” but it does not explicitly evaluate multi-agent frameworks or LLMs across the enumerated tasks (collaborative drug discovery, hospital simulation, etc.). The term “LLM” appears nowhere; coverage is therefore incomplete.

• Regarding Point (7) of Plan A: Frontier directions and challenges (automated loops, human-AI collaboration, safety, ethics, bias)  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B devotes sections (7) Technical levers, (9) Evaluation designs, (10) Governance, and (12) Open problems to exactly these issues—automation, safety, robustness, ethics, dual-use, bias, and human-AI workflows.

III. Summary of Core Differences  
1. Specificity vs Generality: Plan A grounds each domain with named, high-impact exemplar systems (AlphaFold, AI-Newton, ChatDev, MimiTalk, Therabot). Plan B opts for a more generic, methodological taxonomy; consequently, many exemplar-level details are missing.  
2. LLM & Multi-Agent Emphasis: Plan A foregrounds LLM-driven and explicitly multi-agent frameworks as cross-cutting enablers. Plan B rarely mentions LLMs and only implicitly references multi-agent ideas through “agent-based simulations.”  
3. Depth Balance: Plan B provides richer treatment of evaluation protocols, governance, benchmarks, and uncertainty handling—areas only briefly noted in Plan A—while falling short on concrete domain-specific system analysis.  
4. Perspective: Plan A is application-centric; Plan B is framework-centric, favoring comparative axes (priors, data regimes, risks) and methodological unification.

I. Overall Conclusion  
Partially covered.  Plan B addresses every high-level research point raised by Plan A, but it omits or only vaguely treats several concrete sub-points—especially the explicit enumeration of existing systems/models (PEGASUS-large, FigGen, ViT-based formula OCR, CiteBART, ScholarCopilot; AI Scientist, Agent Laboratory, Zochi) that Plan A requires.  Hence coverage is conceptually broad but materially incomplete.

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  

• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A (definition of paradigms)  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B section 1(a) explicitly defines “Semi-automatic academic writing” versus “Full-automatic systems,” mirroring Plan A’s distinction and adding operational metrics for “oversight density.”  

• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A (survey of semi-automatic techniques by phase)  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis:  
    – Plan B section 2 divides the workflow into Preparation/Writing/Revision exactly as Plan A requests and describes functions such as title/outlining help, figure/equation handling, citation recommendation, grammar revision, etc.  
    – However, Plan B gives only generic descriptions; it never cites the concrete models named in Plan A (PEGASUS-large for title optimisation, FigGen, ViT-based formula transcription, CiteBART, ScholarCopilot, XtraGPT, OverleafCopilot). Thus the categorisation exists, but the “current techniques and models” enumeration is missing.  

• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A (deep analysis of full-automatic systems AI Scientist / Agent Laboratory / Zochi)  
  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B section 3 discusses multi-agent planners, retrievers, drafters, critics, controllers and their self-refinement loops—matching the architectural focus requested.  Yet it fails to mention or analyse the specific flagship systems listed in Plan A.  Therefore the mechanism-level description is present, but the concrete system case studies are absent.  

• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A (comparative strengths/limitations of the two paradigms)  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B section 4 presents a structured comparison on human oversight density, provenance, accountability and quality; earlier section 1(c) also frames key comparative questions.  These discussions directly match Plan A’s requested comparison across quality, integrity, efficiency and human effort.  

• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A (evaluation of citation correctness challenges)  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B dedicates an entire block (5) to “Evaluation criteria and metrics for limitations (citation and contextual accuracy)”, giving precision/recall metrics, identifier-resolvability checks, retraction flags, etc., thereby satisfying and extending Plan A’s requirement.  

• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A (frontier directions & future challenges)  
  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s sections 7, 8, 9 outline authorship norms, governance, open research gaps, safer automation principles, and deliverables—addressing reliability of full automation, improved human-AI collaboration, and residual need for human editing.  

III. Summary of Core Differences  

1. Specificity vs Generality: Plan A demands named, state-of-the-art systems and models; Plan B mostly abstracts to generic functionalities and architectures.  
2. Additional Scope in Plan B: The AI-generated plan adds empirical methodology (datasets, experimental design, statistics), governance/ethics, authorship disclosure, cost/sustainability—topics not explicitly requested by Plan A.  
3. Missing Concrete Case Studies: Plan B lacks direct discussion of AI Scientist, Agent Laboratory, Zochi and the semi-automatic tools PEGASUS-large, FigGen, etc., which were central exemplars in Plan A.  
4. Depth Trade-off: While Plan B goes deeper into evaluation metrics and oversight protocols, it sacrifices the concrete system-level survey that Plan A treats as essential evidence.

I. Overall Conclusion  
Plan B covers the vast majority of research points contained in Plan A and often adds additional detail or concrete evaluation protocols.  However, coverage is not completely exhaustive.  A few Plan A items are only touched implicitly or are missing altogether (e.g., explicit discussion of Graph Models for interdisciplinary AI, “training-free” debiasing techniques, explicit treatment of negative-transfer analysis, and hardware-level integration requirements for self-driving laboratories).  Hence the verdict is: **Partially Covered (substantial but not full).**

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  

• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A – “Define the core concepts/frontiers (6 areas)”  
  – Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  – Rationale and Analysis:  
    • Plan B section (1a-c) explicitly “Define AI4Research” and lists constraints across ethics & safety, causal explainability, human-AI collaboration (real-time), multimodality/multilinguality, and architectural options—directly aligning with the six frontiers in Plan A.  
    • “Interdisciplinary models” are captured by the “integrating interdisciplinary, multimodal, multilingual data” statement and later by foundation/domain-specialised models.  

• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A – “Survey mainstream techniques per frontier”  
  – Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  – Rationale and Analysis:  
    a. Interdisciplinary AI → Plan B (2a, 2b) covers “Foundation models in science” but does not explicitly list Graph Models; therefore only partial.  
    b. Ethics & Safety → Plan B (2d, 6b) lists bias reduction, provenance pipelines, privacy audits, benchmarks; fairness-aware training described, but “training-free debiasing” is absent—partial.  
    c. Collaborative Research → Plan B (2g, 5a) mentions “federated learning (secure aggregation/DP/TEEs)” and multi-agent frameworks; fully covered.  
    d. Explainability → Plan B (2e, 7c) gives both mechanistic (white-box) and post-hoc (black-box) methods; fully covered.  
    e. Real-Time Experimentation → Plan B (2c) “agentic science, self-driving labs” and later mixed-initiative control; fully covered.  
    f. Multimodal/Multilingual Integration → Plan B (5c, 9c) outlines curated multimodal/multilingual corpora, common schemas/ontologies, performance trade-offs; fully covered.  

• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A – “Deep mechanism analysis of each technique”  
  – Coverage Status: Largely Covered (minor gaps)  
  – Rationale and Analysis:  
    a. Heterogeneous data & cross-domain transfer → Plan B (1a, 2a-b, 9a) discuss domain heterogeneity, risk of distribution shift, and hybrid modeling—covered.  
    b. Debiasing mechanisms & ethical frameworks → Plan B (6b, 6e) details bias reduction pipelines, policy-as-code enforcement—covered, but no explicit “training-free” debiasing.  
    c. Human-AI interaction protocols & federated training → Plan B (8a-c, 5a) gives role assignment, secure aggregation, zero-trust orchestration—covered.  
    d. White-box vs black-box explainability internals → Plan B (7c) details circuitry analysis vs post-hoc explanations—covered.  
    e. Closed-loop autonomous experimentation → Plan B (2c, 5b, 7d) describe sim→robotics loops, active experimental design—covered.  

• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A – “Compare strengths/limitations & trade-offs”  
  – Coverage Status: Fully Covered  
  – Rationale and Analysis:  
    • Plan B (3a-e) explicitly enumerates “ethics vs performance”, “transparency vs capability”, “real-time collaboration vs oversight”, and “multilingual equity vs uniform performance”.  
    • Data-privacy vs accessibility is captured under “federated vs monolithic” and privacy risk; capacity-vs-coverage tension for multilingual models is hinted but not named—still largely covered.  

• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A – “Evaluate capability of frameworks against grand challenges”  
  – Coverage Status: Partially Covered  
  – Rationale and Analysis:  
    a. Negative transfer mitigation – Plan B warns of “distribution shift” but does not explicitly analyse negative transfer—partial.  
    b. “Plagiarism singularity / dichotomous mania” – Plan B (1b, 6c) directly addresses synthetic-data contamination (“model collapse risk”)—fully covered.  
    c. Low-latency decision-making in self-driving labs – Plan B (8a, 10c) sets “few-second latency targets” and Phase-3 stress tests—covered.  
    d. Scarcity of cross-modal data & uncertainty quantification – Plan B (5c, 4d) includes curated corpora and uncertainty metrics—covered.  

• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A – “Summarize future research directions & open questions”  
  – Coverage Status: Mostly Covered  
  – Rationale and Analysis:  
    a. Standardised explainability/fairness metrics – Plan B (4a-b, 12b) provides metric suites—covered.  
    b. High-quality multimodal/multilingual datasets – Plan B (5c, 9c) proposes provenance-labelled corpora—covered.  
    c. Robust human-AI interaction models – Plan B (8a-d) focuses on mixed-initiative, cognitive ergonomics—covered.  
    d. Hardware-software integration for automated labs – Plan B mentions real-time lab stress tests but not hardware integration specifics (sensors, robotics controllers, low-level IO); partial.  

III. Summary of Core Differences  

1. Specific Technique Gaps: Plan B omits a direct treatment of Graph Models for interdisciplinary AI and does not single out “training-free” debiasing techniques.  
2. Depth on Negative Transfer & Hardware Integration: Plan A asks for detailed evaluation of negative-transfer issues and low-level hardware–software coupling; Plan B treats distribution shift generically and focuses on architectural orchestration, leaving hardware integration largely implicit.  
3. Perspective: Plan B adds operational/process layers (team roles, tool orchestration, phased roadmap, risk register) that are absent in Plan A; this broadens scope beyond the strictly technical research questions of Plan A.  
4. Methodology Focus: Plan B is more implementation-oriented (proposes evaluation metrics, A/B protocols, governance mechanisms), whereas Plan A emphasizes conceptual mapping and comparative analysis of frontier techniques.  

In short, Plan B delivers broad and often deeper coverage, but several niche yet important elements of Plan A are either missing or only implicitly addressed, making the overall coverage substantial but incomplete.
