  "question": "\nGiven the progression of AI's role across the three stages of academic peer review\u2014from a logistical facilitator in the Pre-Review stage (automating desk-reviews and reviewer matching) to a direct content generator in the In-Review stage (employing single-agent, iterative, and multi-agent systems to create reviews and meta-reviews), and finally to a shaper of scholarly legacy in the Post-Review stage (predicting influence and enhancing promotion)\u2014how does this evolving spectrum of AI intervention fundamentally challenge and redefine the traditional criteria for scholarly quality, the division of labor between humans and machines, and the very definition of what constitutes a valid and impactful academic contribution?\n",
