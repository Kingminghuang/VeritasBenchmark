  "question": "\nConsidering the proposed two-stage process of \"AI for Academic Survey,\" how does the evolution of methodologies in \"Related Work Retrieval\"\u2014from semantic and graph-guided approaches to sophisticated LLM-augmented and multi-agent systems\u2014directly enable and shape the increasing complexity and scope of \"Overview Report Generation,\" from initial research roadmap mapping to the autonomous creation of entire document-level surveys?\n",
  "research_plan": "\n(1) Define the two-stage process of \"AI for Academic Survey,\" clearly delineating the functions of \"Related Work Retrieval\" and \"Overview Report Generation.\"\n(2) Analyze the initial methodologies for \"Related Work Retrieval,\" such as semantic search and graph-guided approaches. Investigate how these methods supported early \"Overview Report Generation\" tasks like creating research roadmaps and identifying key clusters of work.\n(3) Examine the impact of introducing LLM-augmented systems into the retrieval process. Detail how improved contextual understanding and summarization capabilities in retrieval directly enable more sophisticated generation tasks, such as synthesizing arguments and identifying specific research gaps.\n(4) Investigate the latest advancements in retrieval using multi-agent systems. Explain how these systems conduct more strategic and comprehensive searches by simulating research teams, debating paper relevance, and autonomously exploring sub-topics.\n(5) Connect the capabilities of multi-agent retrieval systems to the goal of generating entire document-level surveys. Analyze how the structured, comprehensive, and context-rich output from these systems provides the necessary foundation for autonomously writing a full academic review.\n(6) Discuss how the underlying retrieval methodology (semantic, graph-based, LLM-augmented, multi-agent) fundamentally shapes the structure, narrative, and analytical depth of the final generated overview report.\n(7) Synthesize the findings to illustrate the co-evolutionary relationship between retrieval and generation, concluding how advancements in the former are the primary drivers enabling greater complexity, scope, and autonomy in the latter.\n"
