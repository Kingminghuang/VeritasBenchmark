  "research_plan": "\n(1) Define the two primary paradigms of AI in academic writing: semi-automatic assistance (human-in-the-loop collaboration) and full automation (autonomous systems).\n(2) Detail the collaborative functionalities of semi-automatic systems across the three phases: preparation (e.g., literature search, outlining), writing (e.g., drafting, co-writing), and revision (e.g., grammar, style polishing).\n(3) Describe the methodologies of full-automatic systems, focusing on self-refining loops and multi-agent architectures (e.g., planner, writer, reviewer agents) that aim to produce a complete manuscript autonomously.\n(4) Contrast the role and necessity of human oversight in each paradigm, comparing the 'human-as-director' model in semi-automatic systems with the 'human-as-final-approver' or 'human-out-of-the-loop' model in full-automatic systems.\n(5) Analyze and compare the current limitations of both paradigms, specifically focusing on challenges in maintaining accurate citation practices and ensuring deep contextual accuracy in the generated text.\n(6) Investigate the implications of each paradigm for the evolving habits of scholarly manuscript creation, including effects on research workflows, skill development, and the focus of human researchers.\n(7) Examine the implications for scholarly integrity, contrasting the risks and safeguards related to originality, plagiarism, and the attribution of authorship in semi-automatic versus full-automatic writing.\n(8) Synthesize the findings to provide a comprehensive conclusion on how these contrasting approaches are shaping the future of academic writing, highlighting the core tensions between efficiency, human control, and scholarly values.\n"
