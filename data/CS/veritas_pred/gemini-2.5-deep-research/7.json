  "research_plan": "\n(1) Define the three-stage progression of AI's role in academic peer review: Pre-Review (logistical facilitation), In-Review (content generation), and Post-Review (legacy shaping).\n(2) Analyze the impact of AI in the Pre-Review stage, focusing on how automated desk-reviews and reviewer matching affect efficiency, fairness, and potential biases.\n(3) Examine the different AI methodologies used in the In-Review stage (single-agent, iterative, and multi-agent systems) for generating reviews and meta-reviews, and assess their capabilities and limitations.\n(4) Investigate the implications of AI in the Post-Review stage, particularly how predicting scholarly influence and enhancing paper promotion could alter research incentives and priorities.\n(5) Address how this spectrum of AI intervention challenges traditional criteria for scholarly quality. Discuss whether AI-generated critiques can adequately assess novelty, rigor, and significance compared to human experts.\n(6) Analyze the shifting division of labor between humans and machines, contrasting the traditional role of a human reviewer with new potential roles like AI-supervisor, validator, or collaborator.\n(7) Explore how AI's involvement redefines what constitutes a valid and impactful academic contribution, considering the tension between human judgment and algorithmic prediction of impact.\n(8) Synthesize the findings to provide a comprehensive conclusion on the fundamental changes AI brings to the peer review ecosystem, outlining the key challenges and opportunities for the future of scholarly evaluation.\n"
