  "question": "\nConsidering AI's role in automating workflows, accelerating discovery, and generating novel insights, how does its application and impact fundamentally differ across the natural sciences (physics, biology, chemistry), applied sciences (robotics, software engineering), and social sciences (sociology, psychology), and what do these variations reveal about the distinct challenges of each domain, such as the integration of physical priors, the sim-to-real gap, and the modeling of complex, biased human behavior?\n",
  "research_plan": "\n(1) Define the three scientific domains and the overarching role of AI within them: Natural Sciences (discovering fundamental principles), Applied Sciences (creating practical solutions), and Social Sciences (understanding human behavior).\n(2) Analyze the application and impact of AI in the Natural Sciences (e.g., AlphaFold in biology, simulation in physics). Focus on the primary challenge of integrating immutable physical laws and priors into AI models to ensure their validity.\n(3) Investigate the application and impact of AI in the Applied Sciences (e.g., control systems in robotics, code generation in software engineering). Focus on the critical challenge of bridging the \"sim-to-real gap,\" where models trained in simulation must perform reliably in the physical world.\n(4) Examine the application and impact of AI in the Social Sciences (e.g., sentiment analysis, social network modeling). Focus on the core difficulty of modeling complex, noisy, and ethically sensitive human behavior, while accounting for inherent data biases.\n(5) Conduct a comparative analysis of the three domains. Contrast how the nature of the data (objective physical data vs. interactive environmental data vs. subjective human data) and the goals (prediction vs. control vs. explanation) shape AI's role and limitations.\n(6) Synthesize the findings to explain what these variations reveal about the distinct epistemological and methodological challenges of each domain.\n(7) Conclude by summarizing how tailoring AI approaches to these unique domain-specific challenges is essential for advancing scientific discovery across all fields.\n"
