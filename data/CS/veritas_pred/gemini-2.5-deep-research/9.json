  "question": "\nGiven the proliferation of specialized datasets, benchmarks, and tools designed to enhance AI's role across the scientific research lifecycle\u2014from initial comprehension and survey generation to discovery, writing, and peer review\u2014how does this task-specific approach to resource development create a fundamental tension between advancing AI capabilities on discrete, measurable sub-problems and holistically assessing an AI's capacity for genuine, end-to-end scientific advancement, and what new integrated evaluation frameworks would be necessary to bridge the gap between performance on these siloed benchmarks and a true measure of authentic scientific contribution?\n",
  "research_plan": "\n(1) Define the current landscape of AI for science, categorizing the specialized datasets, benchmarks, and tools according to their function in the research lifecycle (e.g., comprehension, discovery, writing, peer review).\n(2) Analyze the benefits of this task-specific approach, explaining how breaking down the scientific process into discrete, measurable sub-problems (like summarization or fact-checking) has accelerated AI development in narrow domains.\n(3) Detail the fundamental tension that arises from this approach: the gap between high performance on siloed benchmarks and the ability to perform genuine, end-to-end scientific work. Use examples to illustrate how success in sub-tasks does not guarantee holistic scientific reasoning.\n(4) Critique the limitations of current evaluation metrics (e.g., ROUGE, accuracy), explaining why they are insufficient for measuring higher-order scientific contributions like novelty, synthesis, and valid hypothesis generation.\n(5) Research and identify emerging concepts for integrated evaluation frameworks. This includes exploring methodologies like end-to-end task simulation (e.g., from a research question to a draft paper) and human-in-the-loop assessments by domain experts.\n(6) Propose a conceptual model for a new, integrated evaluation framework. This model should specify how to combine quantitative performance on discrete sub-tasks with qualitative, expert-driven assessments of the AI's contribution to a holistic scientific workflow.\n(7) Define potential metrics for measuring \"authentic scientific contribution\" within this new framework, such as the novelty of generated insights, the soundness of proposed experiments, or the ability to accelerate human discovery.\n(8) Synthesize the findings to conclude how adopting such integrated frameworks is essential to guide AI development from merely solving isolated problems to becoming a true partner in scientific advancement.\n"
