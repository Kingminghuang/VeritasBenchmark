  "question": "\nGiven the two primary paradigms of AI in academic writing\u2014semi-automatic assistance and full automation\u2014how do the specific collaborative functionalities across the three phases of semi-automatic writing (preparation, writing, and revision) fundamentally contrast with the self-refining, multi-agent methodologies of full-automatic systems in terms of their reliance on human oversight, their current limitations in areas like citation and contextual accuracy, and their ultimate implications for the evolving habits and integrity of scholarly manuscript creation?\n",
