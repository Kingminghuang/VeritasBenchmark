  "question": "\nGiven the proliferation of specialized datasets, benchmarks, and tools designed to enhance AI's role across the scientific research lifecycle\u2014from initial comprehension and survey generation to discovery, writing, and peer review\u2014how does this task-specific approach to resource development create a fundamental tension between advancing AI capabilities on discrete, measurable sub-problems and holistically assessing an AI's capacity for genuine, end-to-end scientific advancement, and what new integrated evaluation frameworks would be necessary to bridge the gap between performance on these siloed benchmarks and a true measure of authentic scientific contribution?\n",
