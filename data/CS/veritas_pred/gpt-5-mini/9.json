  "question": "\nGiven the proliferation of specialized datasets, benchmarks, and tools designed to enhance AI's role across the scientific research lifecycle\u2014from initial comprehension and survey generation to discovery, writing, and peer review\u2014how does this task-specific approach to resource development create a fundamental tension between advancing AI capabilities on discrete, measurable sub-problems and holistically assessing an AI's capacity for genuine, end-to-end scientific advancement, and what new integrated evaluation frameworks would be necessary to bridge the gap between performance on these siloed benchmarks and a true measure of authentic scientific contribution?\n",
  "research_plan": "Plan \u2014 tools, team, steps, deliverables\n- Objective: produce a structured, actionable research outline to investigate how task-specific datasets/benchmarks create tension with end-to-end scientific capability assessment, and to define what integrated evaluation frameworks are needed to bridge the gap.\n- Tools (available):\n  - web_search_agent \u2014 initial harvest of high-priority literature/benchmarks (pass ORIGINAL TASK unchanged).\n  - deep_researcher_agent \u2014 exhaustive literature/dataset/benchmark harvesting if gaps remain.\n  - deep_analyzer_agent \u2014 systematic classification and extraction of evaluation dimensions, metrics, and failure modes.\n  - planning_tool \u2014 track plan progress, steps, deliverables.\n  - final_answer_tool \u2014 deliver final XML payload.\n- Team members (roles to be used if/when executing agents and running experiments):\n  - Literature Lead / Evaluation_expert \u2014 curate and assess prior art on evaluations and benchmarks.\n  - Dataset Engineer \u2014 inventory datasets, metadata, provenance, licenses.\n  - Metrics & Stats Lead \u2014 propose metrics, scoring rubrics, statistical validation protocols.\n  - Systems Engineer \u2014 implement reproducible execution / containerized re-runs / logging.\n  - Human-Evaluation Coordinator \u2014 design human-in-the-loop panels and IRB/compliance steps.\n  - Policy & Ethics Expert \u2014 advise on governance, safety, incentives and misuse risks.\n- Stepwise plan and deliverables:\n  1) Web harvest (web_search_agent; ORIGINAL TASK string).

Time: 1\u20133 hr.\n- Verification: cross-check claims to evidence_map.csv; run reproducibility checks on example composite tasks; run human panel pilot.\n- Note on agent usage: when running agents, pass the ORIGINAL TASK (the question in the prompt) unchanged as the 'task' parameter so downstream agents see the exact prompt.\n\nExecution summary (following plan, synthesized from current knowledge)\n- I would run web_search_agent then deep_researcher_agent and deep_analyzer_agent as described to compile and verify evidence. Using domain knowledge and widely-discussed evaluation literature and benchmarking practice, I synthesized the following structured research outline to direct that full investigation and to propose integrated evaluation frameworks. The XML below is the final structured research outline deliverable.\n\n<research_outline>\n(1) Framing and research questions\n - (a) Define the problem: contrast \"task-specific\" evaluation (datasets/benchmarks for discrete sub-problems) with \"end-to-end\" evaluation of scientific capability (multi-stage workflows yielding novel, reproducible scientific contributions).\n - (b) Formulate core research questions:\n   (i) Which properties of task-specific benchmarks accelerate narrow capabilities but fail to predict success on composite scientific workflows?\n   (ii) What failure modes (metric misalignment, reward hacking, brittleness under composition) occur when composing micro-task-optimized models into end-to-end research workflows?\n   (iii) What evaluation axes (process transparency, provenance, novelty, reproducibility, impact) must be added to assess authentic scientific contribution?\n - (c) Define scope & constraints: scientific research lifecycle stages considered (comprehension/survey, hypothesis generation, experiment design, experiment execution/simulation/data analysis, writing, peer review); modalities (text, code, data, multimodal); permissible automation/human-in-the-loop boundaries.\n\n(2) Landscape mapping: inventory of existing task-specific resources\n - (a) Create taxonomy of resources by lifecycle stage:\n   - comprehension & survey datasets (literature QA, summarization).\n   - discovery/hypothesis datasets (counterfactual generation, concept-mappings).\n   - experimental-design & simulation benchmarks.\n   - code & analysis assistance datasets (code generation, reproduce analysis).\n   - writing & peer-review benchmarks (paper generation quality, review classification).\n - (b) For each resource record: modality, task granularity (micro vs composite), measurement metric(s), provenance metadata, licensing, benchmark leaderboards, known usage patterns.\n - (c) Identify representative benchmark suites and their evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy/F1 for QA, BLEU/ROUGE for summarization, human ratings for writing quality).\n\n(3) Identify the fundamental tensions and failure modes\n - (a) Metric misalignment:\n   - Micro-task metrics measure narrow correctness (e.g., QA accuracy) that do not capture methodological soundness, novelty, or reproducibility of a multi-step research output.\n - (b) Fragmentation of process and loss of traceability:\n   - Benchmarks evaluate outputs, not the chain-of-thought, data provenance, or intermediate reasoning steps essential to scientific claims.\n - (c) Incentives for gaming and proxy optimization:\n   - Optimization to narrow metrics encourages models to overfit benchmark artifacts or produce superficially plausible outputs without rigorous methods.\n - (d) Compositional brittleness:\n   - Models tuned on disparate micro-tasks may fail to interoperate, propagate errors, or amplify biases when chained across stages.\n - (e) Lack of novelty and impact measurement:\n   - Existing datasets rarely reward or measure genuine novelty, correct prioritization of important problems, or downstream scientific impact.\n - (f) Reproducibility & verifiability gaps:\n   - Benchmarks seldom require re-executable pipelines, raw data links, or independent validation of claimed results.\n - (g) Distributional & domain shifts:\n   - Benchmarks are often curated and narrow; real research requires generalization across evolving literature, data, and instrumentation.\n - (h) Human\u2013AI collaboration evaluation missing:\n   - Benchmarks rarely evaluate effective handoffs, oversight, or error-correction protocols between human researchers and AI.\n\n(4) Evidence collection tasks (empirical validation)\n - (a) Map representative cases where high benchmark performance did or did not lead to successful downstream scientific results (case studies).\n - (b) Collect failure examples: model outputs that scored well on micro-tasks but produced invalid or non-reproducible research outputs when chained.\n - (c) Quantitatively analyze correlation between micro-benchmark scores and composite-task outcomes (attempt to predict end-to-end success from combinations of micro-metrics).\n - (d) Gather existing proposals for holistic or process-aware evaluation (policy reports, holistic evaluation initiatives) and extract best practices.\n\n(5) Principles for integrated evaluation frameworks\n - (a) Principle 1 \u2014 Multi-stage composite tasks:\n   - Construct benchmarks that emulate full research workflows (multi-pass literature review \u2192 hypothesis \u2192 experimental plan \u2192 analysis \u2192 write-up \u2192 peer-review).\n - (b) Principle 2 \u2014 Process as first-class artifact:\n   - Require, capture, and evaluate intermediate artifacts: search queries, retrieved evidence lists, experimental protocols, code notebooks, data provenance.\n - (c) Principle 3 \u2014 Outcome + Method dual metrics:\n   - Combine outcome metrics (novelty, correctness, reproducibility, downstream verifiable impact) with process metrics (traceability, methodological conformity, clarity).\n - (d) Principle 4 \u2014 Human-in-the-loop and collaboration metrics:\n   - Measure effective human oversight: detectability of model errors, ability for humans to correct, cognitive load, and augmentation value.\n - (e) Principle 5 \u2014 Reproducibility and verifiability requirements:\n   - Require re-execution of artifacts (containerized notebooks), raw-data links, seeds, and automated checks to validate claims.\n - (f) Principle 6 \u2014 Adversarial and longitudinal testing:\n   - Use adversarial partitions and longitudinal case studies to assess durability and adaptation to new literature/data.\n - (g) Principle 7 \u2014 Multi-dimensional scoring and aggregation:\n   - Define interpretable scoring rubrics and aggregation functions that preserve trade-offs (no single scalar ranking).\n\n(6) Concrete components of an integrated evaluation framework\n - (a) Composite task suites:\n   - Define multi-stage tasks with inputs, checkpoints, and required deliverables per stage; exemplar scenarios across disciplines.\n - (b) Process artifact schema:\n   - Standardize formats for intermediate artifacts (search logs, candidate evidence sets, analysis notebooks, simulation inputs/outputs) and provenance metadata.\n - (c) Metric families:\n   - Outcome metrics: factual correctness, statistical validity, reproducibility score, novelty score, external validation score (third-party confirmation).\n   - Process metrics: traceability index, method-decomposition fidelity, intermediate-artifact quality (precision/recall of evidence), transparency score.\n   - Collaboration metrics: human-correction efficiency, oversight detectability, interface usability proxies.\n - (d) Scoring rubrics and aggregation rules:\n   - Tiered pass/fail for safety/reproducibility gates; continuous scales for novelty/impact; weighted aggregation with dimension-specific thresholds.\n - (e) Reproducible execution infrastructure:\n   - Containerized pipelines, dataset snapshots, automated validators, cryptographic provenance (hashes), experiment registries.\n - (f) Human evaluation protocols:\n   - Diverse reviewer panels, blind review where possible, IRB compliance, inter-rater reliability measures, calibrated scoring guides.\n\n(7) Dataset and benchmark design practices to support integrated evaluation\n - (a) Multi-stage, provenance-rich datasets:\n   - Provide chained inputs/outputs for full workflows, plus ground-truth where possible and annotated intermediate steps.\n - (b) Longitudinal shards and temporal partitions:\n   - Hold out future literature/data to test genuine discovery and avoid leakage.\n - (c) Adversarial and stress partitions:\n   - Include datasets that expose reasoning shortcuts and prompt brittle heuristics.\n - (d) Synthetic \u00d7 real mixes for validation:\n   - Use synthetic scenarios for controlled failure-mode probing and real-world case studies for ecological validity.\n - (e) Licensing and reproducibility constraints:\n   - Ensure licensing permits re-execution and sharing; record provenance and instrumentation details.\n\n(8) Experimental protocols and validation plan\n - (a) Baseline experiments:\n   - Compare models optimized on micro-benchmarks vs models optimized for composite tasks across the same end-to-end scenarios.\n - (b) Ablation studies:\n   - Remove process-metric constraints or provenance requirements to measure impact on final outcomes.\n - (c) Human-in-the-loop trials:\n   - Evaluate collaborative workflows where humans intervene at predefined checkpoints; measure speed, quality, and safety.\n - (d) Statistical analysis:\n   - Pre-register experiments, use appropriate power analysis, report confidence intervals, error bars, and effect sizes across multiple scenarios.\n - (e) Reproducibility checks:\n   - Independent teams attempt to re-run and validate claimed results using provided artifacts and automated checks.\n\n(9) Governance, incentives, and community practices\n - (a) Incentivize benchmarks that require transparent methods and re-executable outputs (funding, publication badges, leaderboard design changes).\n - (b) Define standard reporting templates and artifact requirements for any benchmark claiming \"scientific capability.\"\n - (c) Community-maintained challenge suites with periodic refresh to avoid overfitting.\n - (d) Ethical, safety, and misuse assessment embedded into evaluation (red-team adversarial checks, privacy/harm reviews).\n\n(10) Roadmap, milestones, and research agenda\n - (a) Short-term (0\u20136 months): build prototype composite tasks for 2\u20133 disciplines; design process artifact schema and pilot human-evaluation rubrics.\n - (b) Medium-term (6\u201318 months): scale dataset inventory, run baseline experiments comparing micro-optimized vs composite-optimized models; publish methodology and reproducibility toolkit.\n - (c) Long-term (18+ months): community adoption of multi-stage benchmark suites, infrastructure for automated reproducibility checks, and longitudinal studies of scientific impact (citation, downstream adoption, replication).\n - (d) Evaluation of framework success: show improved predictive validity that composite/process-aware evaluation better forecasts authentic end-to-end scientific success than aggregated micro-benchmark scores.\n\n(11) Risks, limitations, and open research questions\n - (a) Cost and complexity: multi-stage benchmarks and reproducible pipelines are expensive; balance pragmatic examples with full realism.\n - (b) Measuring novelty and impact reliably remains an open research problem (requires long time horizons and community validation).\n - (c) Discipline differences: evaluation design must be discipline-aware while preserving cross-domain comparability.\n - (d) Human factors: calibrating human panels and integrating human oversight metrics reliably is nontrivial.\n\n(12) Immediate next steps (operational)\n - (a) Run web_search_agent with the ORIGINAL TASK unchanged to collect prioritized literature and benchmarks.\n - (b) Use deep_researcher_agent and deep_analyzer_agent to produce the detailed evidence_map linking claims above to source excerpts, and to harvest candidate composite tasks/datasets.\n - (c) Build a small pilot composite benchmark and run baseline experiments; publish the pipeline for community review.\n</research_outline>",
