  "question": "\nConsidering the overarching goal of advancing AI for Research (AI4Research) by integrating interdisciplinary, multimodal, and multilingual data into powerful, general-purpose models, how do the concurrent and often conflicting requirements for ethical integrity (e.g., mitigating bias and avoiding a \"plagiarism singularity\"), causal explainability (e.g., resolving the transparency-performance trade-off), and effective human-AI collaboration in real-time experiments collectively challenge this pursuit of a unified system, and what might these tensions imply for the future architecture of scientific AI\u2014a single, monolithic intelligence or a federated ecosystem of specialized, interoperable agents?\n",
  "research_plan": "<research_outline>\n(0) Plan and tool/team orchestration for this research\n  (a) Goal: Produce a clear, hierarchical research outline answering the question and guiding discovery.\n  (b) Tools to be used (as needed):\n      - web_search_agent: initial retrieval of high-relevance sources across ethics, causal explainability, HAI, and scientific AI architectures.\n      - deep_researcher_agent: deeper, iterative web investigation if initial search is insufficient.\n      - deep_analyzer_agent: analysis/synthesis of retrieved materials and any attached files/URLs; no local attachments for this task.\n  (c) Team members and roles (each receives the ORIGINAL TASK):\n      - Research Content Architect: structure/coverage integration across domains.\n      - Ethics & Governance Specialist: bias/fairness, provenance/IP/privacy, synthetic data contamination/model collapse risk.\n      - Causal Explainability Specialist: transparency\u2013performance trade-offs; causal modeling and interventional evaluation.\n      - Human\u2013AI Collaboration (HCI) Specialist: real-time, mixed-initiative workflows, safety, UX, trust calibration.\n      - ML Systems Architect: monolithic vs federated vs hybrid architectures; orchestration, safety layers, interoperability.\n      - Evaluation & Metrics Analyst: operational/causal/ethical metrics, study design, verification.\n  (d) Process steps:\n      1) Broadcast ORIGINAL TASK to team; confirm sub-questions and scope.\n      2) Use web_search_agent \u2192 deep_researcher_agent (if needed) to collect definitions, state of practice, and exemplars.\n      3) Use deep_analyzer_agent to synthesize tensions, methods, and architectural implications.\n      4) Verification: map each clause of the question to outline sections; check for feasibility, measurability, and risks.\n      5) Output: embed final outline within a single <research_outline> element.\n\n(1) Clarify scope, terminology, and problem framing\n  (a) Define AI4Research: integrating interdisciplinary, multimodal, multilingual data into general-purpose models assisting the full scientific lifecycle.\n  (b) Constraints to reconcile:\n      - Ethical integrity: dataset governance, bias/fairness, provenance/attribution, IP/privacy, dual-use; synthetic data contamination/model collapse risk (often dubbed \u201cplagiarism singularity\u201d).\n      - Causal explainability: faithfulness vs accuracy; transparency\u2013performance trade-off; mechanistic vs post-hoc explanations.\n      - Human\u2013AI collaboration: real-time experiments, mixed-initiative control, safety/oversight, reproducibility, latency.\n  (c) Architectural options:\n      - Monolithic general-purpose intelligence (single FM-centric stack).\n      - Federated ecosystem of specialized, interoperable agents (modular, orchestrated, zero-trust).\n      - Hybrid: capable core plus modular co-processors for safety/causality/provenance.\n  (d) Stakeholders/contexts: academic labs, industry R&D, clinical trials, regulated domains, multi-institution consortia.\n\n(2) Survey current landscape and prior art\n  (a) Foundation models in science: language/vision/multimodal/code FMs; RAG + tool-use for scientific tasks.\n  (b) Domain-specialized models: physics-informed nets, protein/materials/climate/healthcare systems.\n  (c) Agentic science: self-driving labs, experiment planners, sim\u2192robotics loops.\n  (d) Data governance/provenance: licensing (DataCite/DOI/RO-Crate), signed pipelines, origin classifiers, watermarking (with caveats on brittleness), immutable audit logs.\n  (e) Explainability/causal toolchains: SCMs, causal discovery, causal representation learning, IRM/ICP (with mixed empirical support), mechanistic interpretability, symbolic regression.\n  (f) Human-in-the-loop platforms: uncertainty-aware decision support, active learning, tiered autonomy, mixed-initiative design.\n  (g) Systems patterns: RAG, tool orchestration, multi-agent frameworks, federated learning (with secure aggregation/DP/TEEs), privacy tech.\n\n(3) Analyze coupled tensions among requirements\n  (a) Ethics vs performance/speed: governance and compliance slow loops and may shrink data breadth; reduce risk but raise latency.\n  (b) Transparency vs capability: black-box models can outperform but lack faithful mechanisms; constraints for interpretability may reduce accuracy.\n  (c) Novelty preservation vs synthetic scale: limiting re-ingestion of generated content preserves originality but reduces economies of scale.\n  (d) Real-time collaboration vs oversight rigor: approvals, logging, and reproducibility add latency to lab control.\n  (e) Multilingual/multimodal equity vs uniform performance: fairness across languages/modalities complicates training and evaluation.\n\n(4) Conceptual frameworks and evaluation criteria\n  (a) Ethics & integrity metrics:\n      - Bias/fairness (group/individual), representation diagnostics, harm/risk indices.\n      - Provenance/attribution completeness, license compliance rate, privacy risk (e.g., membership inference), dual-use risk index.\n      - Novelty/origin: content-origin detection accuracy, synthetic re-ingestion rate, freshness/diversity/novelty scores.\n  (b) Causal explainability metrics:\n      - Interventional AUROC/AUPRC for specified causal tasks;

symbolic regression for law discovery; gray-box pipelines with causal modules.\n  (c) Post-hoc/mechanistic interpretability: interventional attribution, circuit analysis, causal scrubbing; mandate explanation faithfulness audits.\n  (d) Evaluation-by-intervention: active experimental design, counterfactual validation, do-experiments via robotics/simulated labs.\n\n(8) Designing effective human\u2013AI real-time collaboration\n  (a) Mixed-initiative planning: role assignment, intent modeling, dialogue/confirmation protocols, adjustable autonomy, few-second latency targets.\n  (b) Uncertainty-aware UX: calibrated confidence displays, selective prediction/abstention, contrastive/counterfactual explanations tailored to users.\n  (c) Safety gating and governance: tiered autonomy, hold-points, risk-based approvals, live audit views, incident reporting.\n  (d) Cognitive ergonomics: mitigate automation bias, prevent overload, enable rapid error correction;
