  "question": "\nGiven the progression of AI's role across the three stages of academic peer review\u2014from a logistical facilitator in the Pre-Review stage (automating desk-reviews and reviewer matching) to a direct content generator in the In-Review stage (employing single-agent, iterative, and multi-agent systems to create reviews and meta-reviews), and finally to a shaper of scholarly legacy in the Post-Review stage (predicting influence and enhancing promotion)\u2014how does this evolving spectrum of AI intervention fundamentally challenge and redefine the traditional criteria for scholarly quality, the division of labor between humans and machines, and the very definition of what constitutes a valid and impactful academic contribution?\n",
  "research_plan": "<research_outline>\n(1) Frame the problem space and scope\n  (1.1) Clarify the three AI involvement stages in peer review\n    (a) Pre-Review: triage/desk-reviews, policy/ethics/scope checks, plagiarism/similarity detection, reviewer discovery and matching.\n    (b) In-Review: AI-assisted drafting; fully automated single-agent reviews; iterative human\u2013AI co-writing; multi-agent deliberation; meta-review synthesis.\n    (c) Post-Review: impact prediction (citations/altmetrics/uptake/replication), venue-fit recommendations, promotion/visibility optimization, living reviews.\n  (1.2) Identify the three normative axes to be redefined\n    (a) Scholarly quality criteria: originality, rigor, significance, clarity, reproducibility, ethics/societal impact.\n    (b) Human\u2013machine division of labor: capability allocation, oversight, accountability.\n    (c) Definition of valid/impactful contribution: what \"counts\" when AI intervenes across stages.\n  (1.3) Establish guiding assumptions and risk landscape\n    (a) Benefits: scale, speed, consistency, traceability, inclusion (language/accessibility aids).\n    (b) Risks: bias amplification, Goodhart\u2019s law/metric gaming, deskilling, opacity, confidentiality leakage, strategic behavior, overreliance.\n\n(2) Taxonomy of AI interventions and pressure points by stage\n  (2.1) Pre-Review (logistical facilitator)\n    (a) Automation of desk-reviews: scope fit, minimal quality thresholds, ethics checks.\n    (b) Reviewer matching: expertise embeddings, topic/keyword graphs, COI detection.\n    (c) Pressure points: criteria drift in triage;
