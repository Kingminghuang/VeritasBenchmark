  "question": "\nGiven the proliferation of specialized datasets, benchmarks, and tools designed to enhance AI's role across the scientific research lifecycle\u2014from initial comprehension and survey generation to discovery, writing, and peer review\u2014how does this task-specific approach to resource development create a fundamental tension between advancing AI capabilities on discrete, measurable sub-problems and holistically assessing an AI's capacity for genuine, end-to-end scientific advancement, and what new integrated evaluation frameworks would be necessary to bridge the gap between performance on these siloed benchmarks and a true measure of authentic scientific contribution?\n",
  "research_plan": "<research_outline>\n(1) Clarify the problem and scope\n  (a) Define the scientific research lifecycle stages: comprehension/survey, hypothesis generation, experimental design, execution (simulation/wet lab), analysis, writing, peer review, replication, and impact.\n  (b) Define task-specific (siloed) resources: datasets, benchmarks, and tools focused on discrete sub-problems within the lifecycle.\n  (c) Define \u201cgenuine, end-to-end scientific advancement\u201d: progression from problem framing to validated, reproducible findings with meaningful impact under real constraints.\n\n(2) Landscape mapping of current siloed resources\n  (a) Taxonomize datasets/benchmarks by lifecycle stage (literature understanding; QA/survey; hypothesis ideation; design/optimization; data analysis; paper drafting; reviewing/critique).\n  (b) Characterize typical evaluation signals per stage and their limitations: e.g., QA accuracy/F1; design optimization targets; analysis correctness; writing judged via blinded expert rubrics and acceptance/replication outcomes (avoid weak proxies like BLEU/ROUGE for scientific quality); reviewer agreement with structured rubrics.\n  (c) Identify tooling ecosystems: LLM tool-use, lab-automation APIs, simulation environments, notebooks, provenance/audit tools.\n  (d) Summarize progress patterns and constraints of stage-specific optimization.\n\n(3) Analyze the fundamental tension caused by task-specific approaches\n  (a) Proxy\u2013true objective gap (Goodhart\u2019s Law): optimizing narrow metrics vs the true goal of correct, novel, significant, reproducible science.\n  (b) Compositionality and interface failures: strong sub-task scores may not compose; errors propagate across handoffs.\n  (c) Distribution shift/brittleness: static IID benchmarks vs open-ended, noisy, path-dependent real research.\n  (d) Missing incentives for novelty and causal reasoning: emphasis on retrieval/patterns over hypothesis formation and identification of causal structure.\n  (e) Actuation and environment gaps: lack of closed-loop execution, budgets, materials, safety/ethics constraints.\n  (f) Data contamination and overfitting to leaderboards.\n  (g) Under-weighted replication and external validation.\n  (h) Misaligned time horizons: short-run scores vs long-run reproducibility and influence.\n\n(4) Operationalize \u201cend-to-end\u201d assessment targets\n  (a) Process outcomes: coherent research plan, justified hypotheses, executable protocols, rigorous analyses, transparent reporting.\n  (b) Scientific outcomes: correctness, novelty, significance, reproducibility, and downstream impact/adoption.\n  (c) Autonomy levels: assistant (co-pilot), semi-autonomous (human-in-the-loop), fully autonomous; define evaluation for each level.\n  (d) Domain stratification: physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences; map domain-specific gold standards and constraints.\n\n(5) Integrated evaluation frameworks to bridge the gap\n  (a) Closed-loop, longitudinal discovery challenges\n    (i) Multi-phase tasks from question to validated result over weeks/months.\n    (ii) Registered reports: pre-registration of hypotheses/analysis plans; blind review before data collection.\n    (iii) Independent replication phases with external labs/teams and pre-specified success criteria.\n  (b) Scenario-based composite benchmarks with a shared world state\n    (i) Interdependent stages (literature \u2192 hypothesis \u2192 design \u2192 data \u2192 analysis \u2192 paper \u2192 review) with state carried forward.\n    (ii) Penalize error propagation; reward uncertainty-aware recovery and course correction.\n  (c) Simulated-to-real pipelines\n    (i) High-fidelity simulators for safe exploration; validated transfer to wet-lab/field.\n    (ii) Calibrate simulator realism;

report inter-rater reliability.\n    (ii) Mandatory independent replication with preregistered criteria.\n  (f) Provenance, transparency, and interpretability scoring\n    (i) Mandatory experiment logs, data lineage, prompt/code provenance, uncertainty rationales.\n    (ii) Reward calibrated uncertainty, error analysis, ablations, and limitations.\n  (g) Impact forecasting and post hoc validation\n    (i) Predictive peer review: forecast reproducibility and impact; backtest forecasts against realized outcomes.\n    (ii) Longitudinal tracking of adoption, field- and age-normalized citations, and practical utility.\n  (h) Robustness and generalization suites\n    (i) Cross-domain transfers; OOD topic shifts; adversarial/ambiguous literature; noisy/partial data; conflicting evidence.\n\n(6) Metric schema for integrated evaluation\n  (a) Core outcome metrics: correctness (ground-truth/adjudicated), novelty (expert + semantic measures), significance (blinded expert rating), reproducibility (replication success), normalized impact/adoption.\n  (b) Process metrics: plan quality, hypothesis plausibility, design adequacy (power, controls), analysis rigor, reporting completeness and reproducibility.\n  (c) Efficiency and safety: resource/time budgets, biosafety/IRB adherence, ethical compliance.\n  (d) Calibration and reliability: Brier/ECE, robustness under perturbations, failure-mode characterization.\n  (e) Composite scoring: multi-objective Pareto fronts; preregistered, transparent weights; sensitivity analyses of weights and ablations.\n\n(7) Data, infrastructure, and governance requirements\n  (a) Standardized research sandboxes: simulators, synthetic \u201chidden-law\u201d worlds, and reproducible lab platforms with instrumentation APIs.\n  (b) Secure data enclaves and audit trails;
