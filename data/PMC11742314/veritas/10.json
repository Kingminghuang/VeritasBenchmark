Monitoring and feedback\n\nWound monitoring dressings represent a significant advancement in wound care, integrating diagnostic capabilities with therapeutic functions. These innovative dressings use various technologies to monitor vital parameters such as pH, temperature, glucose levels, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby improving the management of wound healing processes. In addition to wound monitoring being particularly important, developing dressings with unique properties for wound recovery and healing is vital. Therefore, creating systems that, in addition to wound monitoring, can also be useful by timely release of a specific dose of wound-healing compounds is known as theranostic smart dressings. Recently, innovative theranostic smart wound dressings have been introduced to facilitate the timely administration of optimal therapeutic doses directly to wound sites and simultaneously enable real-time biomarker monitoring to assess wound conditions. The main advantages of these theranostic materials include improved pharmacokinetics of therapeutic agents, reduced cytotoxicity, and reduced off-target drug effects. However, reports on theranostic wound dressings are limited due to the emerging technology ([Fig. 7](#fig7)).\n\nFor example, Chen et al. in 2017. designed a smart theranostic wound dressing consisting of ciprofloxacin-enhanced luminous porous silicone (LuPSi) designed to detect and combat infected wounds. In vivo studies demonstrated its ability to accurately monitor infected wounds by detecting color changes caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pH changes in the wound area. In addition, the rapid oxidation of LuPSi facilitated the immediate release of ciprofloxacin and effectively inhibited and controlled wound infection [55].\n\nZhou et al. developed a two-layer theranostic wound dressing made of UV-curable GelMA that incorporated antimicrobial vesicles and fluorescent carboxyfluorescein. The dressing released gentamicin sulfate and silver nitrate as antimicrobial agents and showed color changes in response to bacterial toxins or enzymes secreted by _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_. In vitro and in vivo test results confirmed the efficacy and effective and timely response of the dressing for colorimetric detection and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria [56].\n\nSingh et al. designed a smart theranostic wound dressing using an enzyme-responsive polyurethane scaffold with a prodrug and probe, which allows for simultaneous monitoring and treatment of wound infection. Activation of both prodrug and probe was initiated by an extracellular enzyme secreted by bacteria, lipase. In vitro studies demonstrated that this theranostic wound dressing provides accurate colorimetric detection of wound infection while exhibiting high antibacterial efficacy with minimal cytotoxicity. Theranostic hydrogels composed of L-arginine-modified chitosan and oxidized dextran modified with phenylboronic acid have been targeted for treating infected wounds. These pH-responsive and bacteria-responsive hydrogels demonstrated antibacterial properties against methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_. Furthermore, their capacity to induce angiogenesis and collagen remodeling was confirmed through an infectious motor wound-healing model [57]. Zheng et al. developed flexible two-color hydrogels made of polyacrylamide, chitosan, carbon quantum dots, and phenol red to monitor wound pH levels, reduce bacterial infections, and improve wound healing. These hydrogels exhibit remarkable hemostatic and adhesive properties that facilitate wound healing through potent antibacterial effects and skin repair capabilities. Furthermore, they were integrated with a digital data management system to provide real-time assessments of wound status [58].\n\nIn a study by Cui et al., an H2O2-responsive theranostic wound dressing was formulated using graphene quantum dots on luminescent porous silicon, which was injected with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin and embedded in a chitosan film. Fluorescence imaging of the smart dressing was recorded under a UV flashlight (377Â nm) to track free radicals during the healing process. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the smart dressing effectively controlled H2O2 levels in the wound microenvironment and enhanced cell proliferation and migration while significantly enhancing the healing of diabetic wounds [59]. Duan et al. developed a thermal signal-based theranostic approach to diagnose and manage chronic wounds. They used a NIR-active dye, IR820, encapsulated in porous silicon carriers sealed with calcium ions, allowing for the monitoring of photothermal activity generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as photothermal and photodynamic antibacterial therapy [60]. This innovative theranostic platform exhibited remarkable therapeutic effectiveness and ease of detection in models of diabetic wound infections.\n\nMirani et al. developed a multifunctional dressing capable of detecting pH changes to indicate bacterial infections and delivering the antibiotic gentamicin. The dressing demonstrated antibacterial therapeutic effects without harming primary human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, making it a suitable option for treating skin wounds. In addition, a smartphone recording system was implemented to provide quantitative data for patients and healthcare professionals to monitor wound conditions [61]. Although real-time diagnostic sensors [62,63] can provide rapid and real-time monitoring through sophisticated electronic sensors that collect and display data every second or every minute, such advantages are unnecessary for monitoring wound healing, as the healing process takes much longer. In many cases, rapid and real-time monitoring is not helpful ([Fig. 8](#fig8)).\n\n",
