Responsive and controllable management\n\nResponsive and controllable wound dressings significantly advance wound care, offering tailored treatment based on specific conditions. Interestingly, controllable wound dressings are often characterized by being responsive to stimuli and capable of intelligent responses to changes in the wound microenvironment (such as temperature, pH, moisture, etc.) ([Fig. 9](#fig9)).\n\nIn a study by Yutong Yang et al. in 2023, a self-adjusting wound dressing with response to multiple stimuli and control of antibacterial activity was proposed. Specifically, MoS2 was designed as a nitric oxide (NO)-responsive oxygen species (ROS) L-arginine (MSPA) and encapsulated in carboxymethyl chitosan/poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide) (CMCS/PNIPAM) based cryogel was encapsulated by the multiple reaction was included. In response to the slightly acidic environment of bacterial infection, cryogels contribute to the absorption capacity of bacteria through acidic protonation behavior and effectively increase the antibacterial effect of photodynamics. Controllable delivery of ROS, NO, and remote wound management with NIR light was developed as a responsive and controllable system. Nanozyme-based cryogels with multiple stimuli effectively remove bacterial biofilm through NO-assisted photodynamic and photothermal treatment. Multiple enzyme activities such as cryogels effectively eliminate oxidative damage and accelerate collagen deposition and angiogenesis in infected wounds [64].\n\nIn a research work reported in 2018, aqueous solutions of polyvinyl alcohol, combined with magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MNPs) coated with citric acid, were used to produce composite fibers with a 100–300 nm diameter and controllable MNP loading. The fibers are stable in polar solvents such as ethanol and show no MNP precipitation for over 4 weeks. The ability to remotely trigger this release system in the dressing and its biocompatibility and lightweight feature have great potential for using these fibers as a smart drug release agent for acetaminophen (a model drug). This designed system can accommodate various drugs such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, or skin-repairing drugs and can be used as a smart and controllable wound dressing [65].\n\nIn another report by Zi-Yuan L et al., a completely lightweight hydrogel dressing that can rapidly and remotely control dressing changes for chronic wounds was proposed. In this hydrogel dressing, a two-component hydrogel was synthesized: methacrylated hyaluronan (MeHA) and a photosensitive cross-linked ortho-nitrobenzyl derivative (o-NB). Hyaluronan (HA) was designed as the dressing skeleton for its anti-cell adhesion property and promotion of several biological processes, including cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Finally, hyaluronan was functionalized with methacrylate to achieve in situ photogelation to seal the wound surface and promote angiogenesis. The photosensitive molecule o-NB was also used as a cross-linker to enable contactless dressing changes. The dressing system could be activated within 30 s by visible light irradiation (λ > 500 nm) and transformed into a quasi-liquid upon UV irradiation. (λ = 254 nm, 4 min). This wound-free and rapidly removable hydrogel dressing is applicable for treating diabetic wounds. The hydrogel system could gel the wound bed in situ under visible light within 30 s and dissolve by UV light irradiation within 4 min, if necessary. In addition, the possible mechanism, including cell proliferation and inflammatory regulation, of improving wound healing was further investigated. In a diabetic mouse model, significant wound healing was observed within 2–3 weeks due to the reduction of secondary damage during frequent dressing changes. Since this dressing plays a role in the healing processes of epithelialization, collagen deposition, cell proliferation, and inflammation regulation, it indicates a synergistic effect of the responsive hydrogel dressing for therapeutic efficacy. These results suggest that the MeHA-NB hydrogel can promote wound healing by accelerating re-epithelialization and ECM synthesis. Dressing changes with light stimulation have a clear advantage in promoting chronic wound healing, as secondary damage to the newly formed epithelium was minimized [66]. In summary, Responsive and controllable wound dressings represent a more advanced approach to wound care, focusing on dynamic management of the wound environment. In contrast, traditional dressings usually provide static support and protection.\n\n## 4. Advanced skin repair materials\n\nHuman skin is an anisotropic, nonlinear, and viscoelastic material, and its mechanical properties are affected by age, position, hydration, etc. It is essential to measure its frictional interaction with wound dressings by in vivo testing. Therefore, an artificial, measurable skin model for human skin is critical. Nowadays, many artificial skin models (ASM) are commercially available for specific wound-healing purposes. Silicone elastomers and polyurethanes are the most common materials used to prepare ASM [67]. These technological advancements have enabled the creation of innovative wound dressings that enhance the healing process. For example, bioelectric dressings mimic the body's natural electrical signals to promote wound healing and epithelialization [68].\n\nAmong these advanced materials, hydrogels, which are hydrophilic polymer-based materials, can maintain a moist environment and aid wound healing. They have good biocompatibility and biodegradability. On the other hand, hydrocolloids are adhesive dressings that absorb wound exudate and create a moist healing environment, making them suitable for various wound types [69]. Alginates, derived from seaweed, are particularly effective for moderately to heavily exuding wounds as they can absorb large amounts of exudate [69]. Foam dressings are highly absorbent and maintain a moist wound environment, often used for partial and full-thickness wounds [69]. Transparent film dressings provide a barrier to bacteria while allowing gas exchange, making them useful for superficial wounds and skin tears [69].\n\n",

    "question": "\nConsidering the evolution from static to dynamic wound care, how do the inherent therapeutic properties of advanced materials (e.g., the absorbency of alginates or biocompatibility of hydrogels) complement or contrast with the engineered functionalities of stimuli-responsive systems that react to pH, light, or magnetic fields, and to what extent does the choice of the base material itself dictate both the potential and the limitations for creating a single, integrated \"smart\" dressing capable of autonomously managing the complex, multi-phase wound healing process?\n",
    "research_plan": "\n(1) Investigate the core concepts of advanced wound care, defining the fundamental shift from static dressings to dynamic \"smart\" dressings. Differentiate between \"responsive\" systems that react to the wound's microenvironment (e.g., pH, temperature) and \"controllable\" systems that are manipulated by external triggers (e.g., light, magnetic fields).\n\n(2) Survey and list the current mainstream techniques and materials for advanced wound dressings, categorizing them into two primary groups: (a) Stimuli-Responsive and Controllable Systems (e.g., Multi-Stimuli Cryogels, Magnetic Nanofiber Systems, Photosensitive Hydrogels) and (b) Advanced Skin Repair Material Platforms (e.g., Hydrogels, Hydrocolloids, Alginates, Foam, Transparent Films).\n\n(3) For each identified stimuli-responsive system, deeply analyze its functional mechanism.
