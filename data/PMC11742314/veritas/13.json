Artificial skin wound dressings\n\nArtificial skin can be used in various clinical applications, including treating burns, chronic wounds, surgical incisions, and skin graft sites. It is often applied to promote wound healing, reduce scarring, and improve overall outcomes for patients with compromised skin integrity. Artificial skin products continually evolve with advances in biomaterials, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Healthcare providers consider the specific needs of each patient and wound type when selecting the most appropriate artificial skin product for optimal wound care and healing [32]. Artificial skin, also known as skin substitutes or bioengineered skin ([Table 2](#tbl2)), is a synthetic material designed to mimic the structure and function of human skin. It is used in wound care to promote healing, provide a barrier to infection, and support tissue regeneration [70,71]. In manufacturing artificial skin, cell therapy methods, 3D printing skin, factors influential in skin synthesis signaling pathways, and functional biomaterials are used, among which 3D bioprinting skin technology is considered an innovative and effective method of manufacturing artificial skin ([Fig. 10](#fig10)) [72].\n\n## 5.
