Cellular components in wound management\n\nTissue-engineered skin substitutes, categorized into cell-containing matrices and acellular matrices, offer temporary or permanent wound coverage with a minimal risk of infection. Despite their clinical efficacy, these advanced dressings present a cost barrier when compared to commercially available wound dressings [23]. In wound management, a multifaceted approach often incorporates biological molecules and various cells to orchestrate chronic wound control, mitigate scarring, and promote immunomodulation, angiogenesis, and protection. These cellular components maintain moisture balance, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM), and expedite wound closure. Key cellular players include epithelial cells, which facilitate re-epithelialization; fibroblasts, responsible for synthesizing vital ECM constituents such as collagen; keratinocytes, pivotal in epidermal regeneration and wound sealing; and stem cells, like mesenchymal stem cells. Additionally, anti-inflammatory cells, notably macrophages, play a crucial role in dampening inflammatory responses, while melanocytes and adipocytes also contribute to the wound healing milieu [78,79].\n\nA notable investigation by M. Lashkari et al. led to the development of a mesenchymal stem cell-imbued bilayered scaffold. This innovative construct integrates a freshly prepared collagen/alginate hydrogel with polycaprolactone/gelatin fibers, which are electrospun directly onto the hydrogel base. Adipose-derived stem cells are then introduced to this composite structure. Empirical evidence from this study highlights a decrease in inflammation, bolstered angiogenesis, enhanced re-epithelialization, and collagen restructuring in full-thickness wounds of rats treated with the stem cell-enriched bilayered scaffold. Prospective research endeavors are encouraged to explore the integration of antioxidant agents to potentiate mitochondrial donation or to elevate antioxidant enzyme function, thus intensifying the therapeutic antioxidant properties of mesenchymal stem cell-based treatments [79].\n\nIn parallel, specific investigations have leveraged cellular factors within wound dressings to amplify biological compatibility and efficacy. For instance, L. Zhang et al. engineered a dynamic hydrogel bioadhesive tailored to diabetic ulcers. This hydrogel, a collagen and aldehyde-functionalized polyethylene glycol concoction, encapsulates umbilical cord stem cell factors. The resultant bioadhesive demonstrates heightened adhesion capabilities and biocompatibility alongside accelerated cellular engagement, neovascularization, and robust collagen deposition. The researchers posit that diabetic foot ulcers exhibit near-complete healing when treated with this advanced dressing [80].\n\n",
