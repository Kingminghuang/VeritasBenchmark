    "section_content": "### 5.2. Biomimetic wound dressings\n\nBiomimetic wound dressings are advanced wound care products designed to mimic the natural healing environment of the body and promote tissue regeneration. These dressings are typically composed of biocompatible materials that closely resemble the extracellular matrix (ECM) of human tissues [81]. One of the critical features of biomimetic approaches is their structural resemblance to native tissues. By mimicking the architecture and composition of the natural extracellular matrix, these dressings provide a conducive environment for cell attachment and proliferation ([Fig. 11](#fig11)) [82]. Additionally, the incorporation of bioactive molecules in biomimetic materials facilitates biological signaling, guiding cellular response and promoting tissue regeneration [83]. Despite their therapeutic potential, biomimetic wound dressings face cost, scalability, and long-term stability challenges. Manufacturing these advanced materials at scale while ensuring economic feasibility remains a hurdle. Additionally, ensuring the long-term stability of biomimetic materials for sustained performance poses a challenge. Rigorous clinical validation is also essential to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these novel wound dressings [84,85].\n\n",
