    "section_content": "### 5.3. Fish skin wound dressings\n\nUsing fish skin to treat wounds is an old and natural approach to wound management that has gained attention in recent years. Derived from fish skin, typically tilapia or salmon, these dressings have unique benefits in wound healing and tissue regeneration [27,86]. In a paper published in 2022 ([Fig. 12](#fig12)), using methacryloyl gelatin extracted from fish skin (FMA) by grafting optical cross-linking groups onto fish gelatin, synthesized pH-responsive IOFs with structurally vibrant colors using FMA mixt. Chitosan (CS) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) were used to propagate colloidal crystals. The reasons for using fish skin in wound healing are its brilliant biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, as well as its functions to promote tissue growth and accelerate wound healing. In addition, creating interconnected nanopores, composite IOFs with high specific surface area can be combined with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to achieve antibacterial and angiogenic capabilities in accelerating wound healing, as well as PAA incorporated into the hydrogel system. It acts as a pH-responsive unit and can provide wound monitoring [87].\n\nFish skin wound dressings have several key features that make them ideal for wound dressing. They are rich in type 1 collagen, similar to human collagen, and promote cell adhesion and proliferation. The structure of the fish skin allows gas exchange and moisture retention, creating a favorable environment for healing. In addition, fish skin contains bioactive compounds that have antimicrobial properties and reduce the risk of infection in wounds [88]. One of the other main advantages of using fish skin as a wound dressing is its biocompatibility. Since fish skin is biodegradable and mimics human tissue, it reduces the risk of adverse reactions and inflammation. The collagen in fish skin regenerates tissue and accelerates wound closure. Fish skin dressings are also affordable and readily available, making them a good option for both acute and chronic wounds [89,90]. Clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of fish skin wound dressings in wound healing, especially in chronic wounds such as diabetic wounds and burns. The antimicrobial properties of fish skin help prevent infection, while the collagen content stimulates new tissue formation. Fish skin dressings are also effective in reducing pain and inflammation caused by wounds and help the patient's comfort during the healing process [91]. While fish skin wound dressings offer several advantages, challenges such as resource availability, standardization, and cultural acceptance must be addressed. Ensuring consistent quality and safety of fish skin products is critical to widespread adoption. Cultural considerations and ethical sourcing practices should also be considered when using fish skin dressings in different populations [92].\n\n## 6. New advanced and emergent technologies in wound dressing\n\nNowadays, according to the studies conducted on the different classifications of wound dressings ([Fig. 15](#fig15)), it can be seen that wound dressings with natural material origin can be effective in treatment and therapy. Rapid healing of wounds and the combination of these types of dressings with real-time wound analysis can revolutionize the field of wound dressings and improve patient outcomes; however, more research is needed to understand their effectiveness and safety in different clinical settings fully. [Fig. 13](#fig13) shows the effective technologies in smart wound dressings for advanced management of various types of wounds. Several examples of biopolymers applied in the synthesis of smart wound dressings due to their significant advantages are listed in [Table 3](#tbl3). Dressings have a great diversity because the rapid healing of wounds and the multifunctionality of dressings can make the emergence of nanotechnology-integrated dressings essential, so a consensus on their classification is necessary to understand the importance of the field of consumption, industry [93,94,95,96,97,98,99], and technology with innovation. Therefore, the most extensive classifications in wound dressings were reached using the SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases. With this information, it was found that wound dressings can be classified based on the type of wound and purpose of use, technology, and manufacturing industry ([Table 4](#tbl4)) to ensure an appropriate and accurate approach to therapeutic goals and the correct selection of dressings ([Fig. 14](#fig14)).\n\n",
