    "section_content": "### 6.1. FREMS technology\n\n“FRAMES” (Frequency Rhythmic Electrical Modulation System) is a technology that sends biocompatible rhythmic electrical impulses that stimulate cellular activity in the wound area. The treatment method is also known as Lorenz therapy. The operator adjusts the impulse amplitude using a remote control according to the patient's sensitivity threshold and the stimulated tissue. The system modulates maximum amplitude according to the ion balance of the tissue underneath the electrodes to keep it constantly balanced (Biofeedback). Impulses have an active and recovery phase, guaranteeing ion balance in the tissue involved in the process. It has a significant application in accelerating the healing of chronic wounds, including diabetic and venous wounds, chronic wounds, severe burns, and bedsores in older people. This system shows its effectiveness in reducing pain and accelerating wound closure by increasing the stimulation of blood flow to the tissue (enhanced blood circulation helps to deliver nutrients and immune cells that are vital for the healing process), strengthening the formation of granulation tissue, Reducing the intensity of pain with effective electrical stimulation on pain receptors (fiber C) [104] and increasing endorphin (a non-invasive approach that targets the endorphinergic structures of the brain and increases the secretion of beta-endorphins) [105] secretes and accelerates epithelialization, which is very important for wound healing [106].\n\nIn the research project conducted in 2024 by Marco Contardi and his group in order to investigate films based on Alg-PVPI in combination with FREMS in diabetic mouse models, Alg-alginic acid sodium salt, glycerol was used to make Alg-PVPI was used. Alg-PVPI films caused the agglutination of red blood cells and the attachment of platelets to the surface of the Alg-PVPI film, thus facilitating the hemostatic process. In general, it can be said that Alg-PVPI films have a high level of blood and biocompatibility, coagulation effect, and capacity to enhance cell proliferation. To evaluate wound closure with a diameter of 6 mm, diabetic rats were divided into different groups and treated with Alg-PVPI films, treated with FREMS, and simultaneously treated with FREMS and Alg-PVPI films. A photo of the wound was taken immediately after the biopsy (day 1). A two-layer dressing was applied, images were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12, and the degree of wound closure was checked. FREMS technology showed gradual wound closure and resulted in recovery of 70 % of the original damaged area of the wound. Mice treated with PVPI-based films showed a slight difference in the progress of the wound-healing process. In addition, the levels of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, were decreased in mice treated with FREMS and Alg-PVPI. The overall results show how the simultaneous application of FREMS technology and bioactive wound dressing can increase the capacity of both devices to treat hard-healed wounds in diabetic patients [106].\n\nSantamato et al. applied either antiseptic topical alone or with FREMS to venous leg wounds for 3 weeks. They found FREMS led to a decrease in wound surface area by 90 % at 30 days from treatment cessation, which was significantly superior to that seen in the control arm [107]. Eduard Kurz's FREMS was used in a clinical trial involving patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) suffering from narrowing of the neuroforamina and spinal canal. It is still not completely clear whether post-surgery LSS patients are treated with FREMS technique early after surgery or whether delayed recovery would be more beneficial [108].\n\nRCTs randomized controlled trials (to date) have assessed the effect of FREMS on lower extremity wound healing. Unfortunately, all did not clarify whether the participant or investigator was blinded. Also, most studies support the beneficial effects of pulsed current on the protective management of skin wounds. Although waveforms and other methods look promising, there is not yet much experimental data to recommend a definitive conclusion with many healed patients regarding using FREMS in skin wound recovery.\n\n",

    "question": "\nConsidering FREMS technology's demonstrated therapeutic mechanisms—such as enhanced blood circulation, accelerated tissue regeneration, and pain reduction—and its positive outcomes in specific studies, including synergistic healing with bioactive films and superior results for venous ulcers, how do the critical methodological weaknesses of existing research, particularly the lack of blinding in trials, and key unanswered clinical questions, like the optimal timing for post-surgical application, collectively undermine the current body of evidence and prevent a definitive recommendation for its widespread adoption in wound recovery?\n",
