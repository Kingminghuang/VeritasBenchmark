The type of polymer (biological, synthetic, or combined) can be selected according to the kind of wound. In the field of wound healing, these materials may be enriched with functional biological agents such as antibiotic agents, growth factors, and other drugs to accelerate wound healing and create multiobjective wound dressings ([Fig. 16](#fig16)) [23,112,121].\n\nSchadte et al. developed a printable 3D bioink comprising tetrapodal zinc oxide (t-ZnO) nanostructures as the antibacterial agent, combined with a sodium alginate hydrogel to create open porous and closed cell structures with orifices below 500 μm. To examine the antimicrobial activity of the printed wound dressings, the researchers used _Staphylococcus aureus_, a common wound pathogen known for its multi-drug resistance. The study yielded two significant findings. First, while a 5 % concentration of t-ZnO significantly inhibited bacterial growth, increasing the concentration to 15 % further reduced the survival rate of _S. aureus_, with a more pronounced effect in open lattice wound dressings compared to closed ones. Second, bacterial growth was higher on the closed lattice wound dressings than on the open ones, even in the absence of t-ZnO. This finding is crucial for the design of printed wound dressings. The researchers suggested that the antimicrobial effects of t-ZnO are due to its ability to release zinc ions and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are better supported by the open lattice structure. The not fully crosslinked alginate can also retain Zn2⁺ ions, enhancing the antimicrobial properties. Therefore, the most favorable design for a wound dressing would be one with open lattices and fully crosslinked alginate [122,123].\n\nIn another study, Siebert et al. developed a 3D-printed hydrogel patch that encapsulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and incorporates photoactive and antibacterial tetrapodal zinc oxide (t-ZnO) microparticles. This multifunctional scaffold is designed to be light-triggered. To achieve this, they utilized the antimicrobial and semiconductor properties of t-ZnO, which has a bandgap in the UV range, to act as a photoactive agent. This allowed the incorporation of VEGF in the presence of UV–visible light without releasing it during the synthesis process, which involved UV cross-linking. This interdisciplinary work resulted in a controlled release of VEGF, promoting blood vessel formation and providing antimicrobial properties. The in vivo experiments suggest this smart wound dressing platform is highly effective [123].\n\nMoreover, 3D printing wound dressings can be personalized based on the shape and size of the dressings, profile of reales, does, and types of active ingredients of drugs incorporated in it, porosity, swelling, and degradation rate [124]. In their research, Philipp Schadte et al. developed a zinc-oxide-tetrapod (t-ZnO) infused sodium alginate wound dressing platform tailored for patient-specific protein delivery. Utilizing a custom-made setup, they achieved the application of nozzles with orifices smaller than 500 μm. They fabricated structures with varying infill densities, both closed and open, and post-printing, treated them with 1M calcium chloride for 60 s for cross-linking. The t-ZnO-laden alginate platform exhibited optimal antibacterial properties at a 5 % concentration against _S. aureus_ while proving non-detrimental to human skin cells. Furthermore, t-ZnO, the platform's primary component, demonstrated antibacterial prowess and a propensity for binding surface proteins (active pharmaceutical ingredients) with an isoelectric point above 7. The tetrapodal structure of ZnO rendered it significantly less toxic than conventional ZnO. The biocompatible alginate showcased easy gelation, derivatization potential, and excellent printability. The study concluded that the open structures offered superior antibacterial activity without compromising skin integrity [122].\n\n",
