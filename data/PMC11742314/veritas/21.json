Hydrogel-making technology in wound management\n\nIn a study by Kyung Lee and Seungsin Lee, palmarosa essential oil, recognized for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, was integrated as a bioactive agent into the core of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers. This incorporation was facilitated through emulsion electrospinning using a single nozzle, which was succeeded by a heat treatment to augment the aqueous stability of PVA. The resultant core/sheath PVA-based composite, particularly those with a web area density of 3 g/m2, demonstrated satisfactory gas and moisture vapor permeability, critical for effective wound care. Moreover, it showed a notable capacity for absorbing wound exudates. The inherent antibacterial properties of the essential oil, in synergy with the composite's engineered attributes, make this PVA-based material a promising candidate for bioactive wound-dressing applications [125].\n\nIn a notable study by X. Zhang et al., a multifunctional dressing comprising a hydrogel base, magnetothermally responsive microfibers, a drug delivery system, and mesenchymal stem cell-laden microfibers was engineered. The magnetothermally responsive component, consisting of a Fe3O4@SiO2-interpenetrating polymer network (IPN), enables magnetothermal heating via magnetic nanoparticles and exhibits thermoresponsive behavior attributable to the IPN. This design allows for targeted antibiotic release at the desired site. Additionally, including stem cell-laden microfibers promotes enhanced re-epithelialization, tissue remodeling, collagen synthesis, and granulation tissue formation. The hydrogel's structural properties, including its ability to provide a moist environment, absorb exudates, sustain therapeutic cells, and facilitate controlled drug delivery, collectively contribute to accelerated wound healing [126]. Hydrogels may undergo cross-linking via chemical or physical means. Physical cross-linking, which relies on reversible intermolecular interactions, is preferred due to the absence of chemical cross-linking agents, although it may compromise stability and mechanical strength. In contrast, chemical cross-linking involves permanent, robust covalent bonds formed by chemical agents, with the degree of cross-linking influencing the hydrogel's swelling behavior [127].\n\nTo circumvent the issues of toxic photoinitiator residues and slow in-situ curing associated with injectable photo-cross-linked hydrogels, J. Zhang et al. developed an injectable, in-situ photo-cross-linked hydrogel dressing devoid of photoinitiators featuring rapid in-situ curing and robust antibacterial properties. The polymerization is initiated through the photodimerization of the dipole-dipole interactions within the quaternary ammonium heterocyclic rings of polyvinyl alcohol-bearing styrylpyridinium groups (PVA-SBQ) under UV light, rendering the hydrogel biocompatible, free of photoinitiators, water-soluble, and mechanically sound. The hydrogel's antibacterial efficacy also originates from the polymer's positively charged groups. Incorporating a natural macromolecule, oxidized sodium alginate (OSA), enhances biocompatibility and provides ample reactive sites. The inclusion of polydopamine particles endows the hydrogel with photothermal therapeutic capabilities. Ultimately, the study demonstrated that this hydrogel accelerates the repair of infected wounds, supported by its sensitive and stable sensing properties [128]. The future of wound dressing is evolving rapidly with advancements in materials science, biotechnology, and digital health [129]. New international trends in wound dressing are shaping the landscape of wound care and driving innovation in the field. Some key areas and developments in the future of wound dressing are shown in [Fig. 17](#fig17).\n\nThese trends reflect the ongoing evolution of wound dressing technologies and practices on an international scale, focusing on improving patient outcomes, enhancing wound care efficiency, and advancing the field of wound healing. Healthcare providers, researchers, and industry stakeholders are working together to leverage these trends and innovations to address the complex challenges associated with wound management and promote better quality of life for patients.\n\n",
