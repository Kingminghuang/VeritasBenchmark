Electrospinning technology in wound management\n\nAn alternative method for producing wound dressings is electrospinning, which fabricates micro-to nanoscale ultra-fine fibers from both natural and synthetic polymers, provided they are amenable to electrospinning ([Fig. 18](#fig18)). Key parameters influencing the suitability of a polymer for electrospinning include polymer concentration, which must be balanced to mitigate surface tension effects or excessive viscosity; solvent characteristics, such as boiling point, evaporation rate, and vapor pressure; electrical conductivity; molecular weight; and viscosity [130]. The electrospinning process, based on electrohydrodynamics, garners interest due to its ability to produce fibers with small pore sizes, high specific surface area, high porosity, flexibility, low roughness, and mechanical properties akin to human skin, such as ductility and tensile strength. Nanofibrous structures derived from this technique act as breathable barriers that prevent contamination penetration [131], maintain high porosity, exhibit a random mesh arrangement, and preserve a moist environment around the wound by minimizing water loss [125,[132,133,134,135]. Both natural polymers, predominantly sourced from animals and plants, and synthetic polymers are employable in this technique, each offering distinct advantages and limitations. Synthetic polymers excel in mechanical properties, thermal stability, and processing versatility but often lack biodegradability and cell-binding sites. Conversely, natural polymers are noted for their excellent biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and presence of bio-binding sites, albeit with less favorable physical properties. Consequently, blends of both polymer types are frequently utilized in electrospinning to balance desired mechanical characteristics and bio-functionality [24,136,137].\n\nA conventional electrospinning apparatus can produce diverse fibers by modulating parameters such as needle type, polymer concentration, collector and spinneret configuration, voltage, flow rate (solution feed ratio), and the distance between spinneret and collector. This device generates an electric field from the spinneret and sends it to the fiber collector by applying high voltage. The predetermined flow rate ensures consistent injection of the syringe contents. At the needle tip, droplets form, and upon the electrostatic force surpassing the solution's surface tension, a ‘Taylor cone’ emerges. Consequently, a charged polymer jet is expelled from the Taylor cone's apex. The solvent rapidly evaporates during its trajectory, leaving a solid fiber that follows a helical path. Ultimately, the fibers are randomly deposited onto the collector [24,132,138].\n\nIn a study by Kyung Lee and Seungsin Lee, palmarosa essential oil, recognized for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, was integrated as a bioactive agent into the core of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers. This incorporation was facilitated through emulsion electrospinning using a single nozzle, which was succeeded by a heat treatment to augment the aqueous stability of PVA. The resultant core/sheath PVA-based composite, particularly those with a web area density of 3 g/m2, demonstrated satisfactory gas and moisture vapor permeability, critical for effective wound care. Moreover, it showed a notable capacity for absorbing wound exudates. The inherent antibacterial properties of the essential oil, in synergy with the composite's engineered attributes, make this PVA-based material a promising candidate for bioactive wound-dressing applications [125].\n\nA study conducted in 2022 aimed to prepare electrospun chitosan/gelatin nanofiber scaffolds reinforced with different amounts of graphene nanosheets for use as antibacterial and wound healing scaffolds. Nanofibers reinforced with 0.15 % graphene nanosheets produced the smallest diameter (106 ± 30 nm) and the highest porosity (90 %), showing good biodegradability and swelling. It is interesting to note that the reinforced nanofibers With 0.15 % of graphene nanosheets, the growth inhibition percentage of _E. coli_ and _S. aureus_ was 50 % and 80 %, respectively. During culture with nanofibers, cell viability assay did not show any cytotoxicity on human fibroblasts, and graphene nanosheets showed a positive effect on cell migration ability [139].\n\n## 7. Future perspective on wound dressing\n\nScaffolds made from natural materials (proteins such as collagen, gelatin, plasma-derived fibrin, keratin, chitosan, and dextran) have become increasingly popular because they exhibit better cell adhesion, compatibility, and in vivo degradability [4]. Scaffolds are fabricated for wound dressings using various techniques ([Fig. 19](#fig19)). Nanocomposite scaffolds also incorporate nanomaterials into the scaffold structure, resulting in biological benefits such as enhanced angiogenesis and improved mechanical properties [111,140]. Decellularized matrix scaffolds involve the complete removal of tissue cells, allowing for recellularization with alternative cell types, such as stem cells, while maintaining the native, non-immunogenic 3D structure, as well as complex protein complexes [141,142]. Biodegradable polymer scaffolds [143], bioprinted wound dressings, electrospun wound dressings, and hydrogel-based wound dressings are also used. These can be loaded with therapeutic agents [144] to act as drug delivery systems or integrated with sensors for real-time wound monitoring, demonstrating “smart” capabilities.\n\nStem cells from various anatomical sources are used in applications that repair damaged tissue and have shown varying success in preclinical settings. Given that cultured epithelial autografts have been successfully used to regenerate burn scars, future research will focus on epidermal stem cells. This cell type is significant for skin wound healing because it can maintain epithelial homeostasis and requires an available microenvironment to support its pluripotency. These stem cells can control skin morphogenesis, homeostasis, and repair. The loss of epidermal stem cells at the wound margin may be responsible for non-healing wounds. Given the importance and ability of these cells to form intact epithelium, there is a tremendous opportunity for the clinical use of these stem cells and bioengineering technologies in the near future for the treatment of deep wounds [145].\n\nAlthough dermal equivalents or multifunctional dressings have been introduced to the market and some are used by healthcare providers, the healing and cosmetic outcomes are still poor, perhaps reflecting the importance of focusing skin regeneration research intensively on wound healing and closely examining the cellular behavior, molecular pathways, and factors involved in wound maintenance [146]. However, with the continued development of manufacturing techniques, artificial intelligence technologies, and simulations of the wound recovery process, the creation of scaffolds suitable for various types of wounds may be facilitated in the near future.\n\n",
