Innovative approaches\n\nInnovative approaches to wound dressing have evolved significantly in recent years, integrating advances in nanomaterials science, biotechnology, and medicine. These innovations aim to improve wound healing quickly, reduce infection rates, attempt to reduce extensive scarring and achieve healing at the lowest cost. These advances in wound dressing technology demonstrate the potential of responsive and controllable dressings to revolutionize wound care by providing targeted therapy and promoting faster healing processes. Such innovative approaches with smart designs are practical for various wounds [147]. Innovations in smart dressing design include gels such as cryogels and hydrogels, the extensive use of nanoparticles and nanozymes, sensors monitoring wound emergents, and the use of bioactive and biocompatible materials.\n\nCryogels based on nanozymes responsive cryogels with MoS2 were designed by L. Wang in 2023, which contain a nitric oxide (NO) releasing precursor that responds to various stimuli such as pH, near infrared (NIR), and temperature. They adapt to different stages of wound healing and help to attract bacteria and enhance antibacterial efficacy through the release of ROS and NO-induced by NIR light [148]. Injectable hydrogels can respond to matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and release therapeutic agents such as curcumin to enhance wound healing efficiency. This injectable hydrogel dressing is adhesive and self-healing. Hydrogel dressings are made from a combination of materials that form a gel-like environment upon contact with moisture. This helps to create a moist healing environment while facilitating autolytic debridement, or in other words, the removal of dead tissue through the body's natural processes. Hydrocolloid dressings are often used for superficial to moderate wounds [149]. Another example of a responsive hydrogel-based microneedle dressing was developed by Z. Guo in 2022 using a glucose-responsive insulin-releasing hydrogel. This microneedle dressing accelerates diabetic wound healing by releasing insulin in response to glucose levels, leading to improved wound healing outcomes and better blood glucose control [150].\n\nThese advancements in wound dressing technology demonstrate the potential for responsive and controllable dressings to revolutionize wound care by providing targeted treatment and promoting faster healing processes**.**\n\n",
