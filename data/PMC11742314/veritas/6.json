Moisture management\n\nAmong the range of wound dressings available for wound healing, moist dressings have gained considerable popularity due to their ability to create an optimal environment for wound healing. These dressings can absorb and manage wound exudate and maintain a moist environment that promotes healing ([Fig. 4](#fig4)) [9]. One of the essential benefits of using moist dressings is the importance of maintaining and producing the necessary moisture for chronic wounds where the wound bed may be dry and lack the moisture needed for healing and wounds with heavy exudates. These moisture-absorbing dressings can promote rapid wound healing, reduce infection rates, reduce the frequency of dressing changes, and reduce overall treatment costs [37]. Below two examples of different applications of such dressings are examined.\n\nIn 2024, a three-layer temperature-dependent fibrous wound dressing was developed. The dressing consisted of a hydrophilic cotton layer, a thermosensitive layer (TPPU), and a hydrophobic layer of polyurethane (PU) nanofibers. The TPPU layer comprises nanofibers designed from polymers, PU, and silver nanoparticles with an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) via free radical polymerization. The TPPU middle layer showed changes in its wettability upon heating, adjusting the thickness of the hydrophobic layer and ultimately creating the appropriate structure to guide spontaneous fluid transport. The polymer showed hydrophobicity at low temperatures and hydrophilicity at high temperatures. This was observed by a change in the turbidity of the solution from opaque to transparent. The polymer swelled at room temperature due to the formation of hydrogen bonds in its chains, resulting in an opaque solution. Intramolecular hydrogen bonds weakened as the temperature increased, and intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water molecules formed. The positive effect of the newly fabricated dressing was tested on diabetic wounds, as it induced collagen synthesis and increased epithelialization while reducing inflammation and ultimately accelerating the wound-healing process [38].\n\nIn another research work conducted by Zhan Xu et al., a multifunctional diabetic wound monitoring dressing with real-time rapid moisture drainage was designed via a smartphone integrated with Python-RGB applications. Since hyperglycemic tissue exudates and bacterial infections often accompany diabetic wounds, the healing of such wounds has become a significant challenge, which seriously delays the healing of diabetic wounds. Non-adherent, pH-responsive (5–9) dressings with antibacterial properties were proposed for exudate management and wound monitoring. In this synthesis, cellulose was used, and then a pale pink fabric was combined with antioxidants by soaking the nonwoven cellulose in a red cabbage anthocyanin/ethanol solution and air drying. The reason for using red cabbage anthocyanin was its responsiveness to pH changes. Finally, the Janus dressing was prepared by directly electrospinning PCL (polycaprolactone, hydrophobic) and antibacterial chlorhexidine (hydrophilic) on the top layer. With its antioxidant, pH-sensitive, hydrophilic cellulose coating and antibacterial hydrophobic polycaprolactone backing layer that directly contacts wounds, Janus dressing can unilaterally and irreversibly drain wound exudates and weaken moist adhesion to the wound. In this design, the healing process can be monitored in situ based on the distinct pH-responsive colors of the Janus dressing at different stages of healing. In vivo assays and histopathological studies demonstrate superior healing speed, collagen deposition, epithelialization, and angiogenesis of this moisture-absorbing dressing [39].\n\n",
