Antimicrobial activities\n\nMany multi-functional wound dressings incorporate use antimicrobial agents to prevent the growth and spread of bacterial infection into the bloodstream and cause inflammatory shock. These agents can be in the form of antibiotics, antifungals, or other antimicrobial nanomaterials [40,41,42]. Antimicrobial agents can be categorized into several types: chemical-based compounds, plant-derived natural compounds, antimicrobial peptides, and nanoparticles The latter can be further divided into metallic and non-metallic nanoparticles ([Fig. 5](#fig5)) [43]. Some agents from each category have been successfully patented and have entered the market ([Table 1](#tbl1)) [44].\n\n#### 2.2.1. Classification of nanomaterial antimicrobial activity\n\nThe classification of nanomaterial antimicrobial activity encompasses several dimensions, including nanomaterial properties, mechanisms of action, types of microorganisms, and current policies aimed at developing a standardized approach for distinguishing nanomaterial antimicrobial activity ([Fig. 6](#fig6)). The primary types of nanomaterials used for antimicrobial purposes can be categorized as follows:\n\n**Metal-based nanomaterials:** Some metal-based nanoparticles, such as Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), and iron nanoparticles (FeNPs), which release metal ions can disrupt bacterial function [45]. AgNPs are the most extensively studied and utilized antimicrobial nanomaterials due to their broad-spectrum activity against bacteria, viruses, and fungi [46]. AgNPs can damage the microbial cell membrane, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inhibit microbial DNA. They have also been shown to phosphorylate key bacterial proteins and inactivate their regulatory mechanisms for cellular processes such as exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and transport [47]. Although AuNPs are less commonly used than AgNPs, their antimicrobial properties have been consistently investigated. Generally, AuNPs are often combined with other antimicrobial agents to enhance efficacy and can be functionalized to target specific pathogens [46].\n\n**Metal oxide nanoparticles:** The photocatalytic properties of TiO2 nanoparticles are effective in destroying microorganisms through light-induced ROS production, making them suitable for antimicrobial coatings and surfaces [46]. In some studies, zinc oxide nanoparticles have been shown to have an effect against a wide range of bacteria. Zinc oxide nanoparticles can disrupt cell membranes capable of producing ROS and bind to microbial proteins and DNA [48].\n\n**Carbon-Based Nanomaterials:** Fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene oxide possess unique structural properties that contribute to their antimicrobial activity. These materials can physically disrupt microbial membranes, leading to their antimicrobial effects [49].\n\n**Biopolymer nanoparticles:** Biopolymer nanoparticles are significant in biomedical applications due to their engineered properties and biocompatibility. These nanoparticles offer advantages such as the controlled release of antimicrobial agents [50,51]**.**\n\n**Composite nanomaterials:** Composite nanomaterials involve the hybridization of different types of nanoparticles to enhance antimicrobial efficiency. For example, composites containing silver nanoparticles have been found to be more effective against certain bacteria than silver-chitosan composites [52].\n\nVarious studies have highlighted the importance of incorporating antimicrobial agents into wound dressings to enhance their effectiveness. For instance, a survey by Meredith and Forbes demonstrated the rapid antimicrobial activity of ionic silver, EDTA, and benzethonium chloride-containing surgical cover dressing compared to other silver-containing dressings [38]. Additionally, research by Liang and Pierce involved the preparation of chitosan hydrogels incorporating a natural antimicrobial peptide, epsilon-poly-L-lysine. The hydrogels were tested for antimicrobial efficacy in vitro and ex vivo. First, the hydrogels were evaluated against planktonic cultures of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, and Candida albicans. The results significantly reduced _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_ populations but were less effective against Candida albicans. Then, the hydrogels were applied to a reproducible porcine ex vivo skin wound model infected with a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of multidrug-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_, and Candida albicans. The results showed that dressings such as alginate/CMC/Ag, cadexomer iodine, and HOCl exhibited promising antibiofilm activity. Specifically, the reduction of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ was significant both in vitro and ex vivo, while the results were ineffective against Candida albicans [53]. These studies demonstrated the importance of antimicrobial activities in various applications including wound recovery, which mainly focuses on multifunctional wound dressings incorporating other antimicrobial agents to reduce the growth of various bacteria and prevent disseminated infections.\n\n## 3. Screenable wound dressings\n\nScreenable wound dressings are advanced medical products designed to assess and manage wounds effectively. They offer a range of functions, including moisture management, temperature regulation, infection control and pH control, while allowing for real-time monitoring of wound status. Advanced wound dressings can simultaneously incorporate monitoring technologies in addition to medications that track the wound healing process and provide feedback to healthcare professionals. This can help optimize treatment and improve patient outcomes [54].\n\n",
