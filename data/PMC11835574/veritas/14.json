Sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM)\n\n**Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) represents a fundamental technique employed in power electronics.** In SPWM, a sine wave known as the modulation signal (_vm_) is compared with two triangular waveforms serving as carrier signals (_vc1_ and _vc2_) to produce PWM signals, as illustrated in [Fig. 19](#fig19)A. To create switching signals for other phases, the modulation signals need to be shifted by 120° relative to one another while still using the same carrier signals. The modulation signal's frequency determines the frequency of the output voltage, whereas the frequency of the carrier signals sets the switching frequency, as depicted in [Fig. 19](#fig19)B. Furthermore, the hexagonal representation of possible voltage vectors for SPWM is shown in [Fig. 19](#fig19)C [121]**. SPWM is widely utilized for its ability to produce high-quality sinusoidal waveforms while effectively controlling harmonic content and achieving desired output characteristics in power conversion applications.**\n\n",
