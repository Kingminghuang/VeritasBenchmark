    "section_content": "### 4.2. Space vector PWM (SVPWM)\n\nAmong the array of PWM techniques previously discussed, wherein three-phase voltage references are modulated individually, stands a distinct approach known as SVPWM. In contrast to conventional PWM techniques, SVPWM operates on the principle of space vectors, representing three-phase voltage references as a vector in the complex plane. This voltage reference vector is subsequently modulated by output voltage vectors generated by the inverter. The adoption of SVPWM has become widespread across numerous three-phase inverter applications due to its ability to produce fundamental output voltages approximately 15.5 % higher than those achieved by conventional SPWM. Furthermore, SVPWM yields reduced harmonic distortion in load currents, mitigated torque ripple in AC motors, and lower switching losses([Fig. 20](#fig20)) [122]. Its superior performance characteristics have rendered it a preferred choice for modern power electronics applications.\n\n",
