    "section_content": "### 4.3. Selective harmonic elimination (SHE) modulation\n\nSHE is a new method used in high-power inverters for modulation. The application of this technique aims to suppress destructive effects, such as excessive heat and grid disturbance. SHE modulation provides an effective solution for eliminating specific harmonics from the voltage waveform output. The general structure for SHEPWM is shown in [Fig. 21](#fig21) [123]. This approach involves solving a set of nonlinear equations, often referred to as the set of harmonic elimination equations, which relate the desired harmonic magnitudes to the associated switching angles. Essentially, the SHE modulation technique encompasses a three-step process: identification of harmonics, formulation of the set of harmonic elimination equations, and then utilizing numerical techniques to solve these equations and achieve selective removal of the targeted harmonics.\n\n",
