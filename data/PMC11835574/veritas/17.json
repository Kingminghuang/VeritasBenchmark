High-Power Inverter's modulation techniques for utilizing in LS-PV-PP\n\nIn reviewing various PWM techniques in LS-PV-PP high-power inverters, we find that these techniques focus on optimizing the conversion of DC power from solar panels to AC power to inject an appropriate output power into the main grid. The three PWM techniques commonly studied include SPWM, SHE PWM, and SVPWM. To enable precise control of high-power multilevel inverters, a new approach is proposed in Ref. [124] for digital modulation of SPWM. This technique finds significant application in systems such as solar pumping and motor drives, where it efficiently manages DC/AC inverter output voltage, minimizing distortion and low harmonic components. The core concept involves converting a sampled, DC-biased sine wave signal into a repetitive pulse train. The widths of these pulses fluctuate sinusoidally, thus giving rise to a digital SPWM. Different amplitude modulation indices, spanning from 0.5 to 1.3 (including over modulation), are implemented and analyzed in practical scenarios. Next research focuses on the development and examination of single-stage photovoltaic generators (PVGs) integrated with CHB-MLI. The aim is to enhance the efficiency of the multilevel inverter by presenting four MLI topologies: three, five, seven, and nine levels. These topologies effectively reduce voltage drops and minimize THD in the output voltage and current by optimizing the inductance value of the L filter on the load side. To regulate the suggested MLI circuits, we apply the Phase Opposition Disposition based on Sinusoidal pulse width modulation (POD-SPWM) technique. In this approach, a modulating sine wave signal with a frequency of 50 Hz is compared to a carrier signal with a frequency of 50 kHz to generate optimal switching combinations that yield a range of output voltage levels [125]. Conventional methodologies applied to multilevel inverter circuits typically entailed a higher component count, thereby constraining the feasibility of boost operation. To surmount this limitation, writers proposed a novel modified multilevel inverter PWM technique that facilitated step-up operation while concurrently minimizing component complexity. In Ref. [126], writers expounded upon the development of five-level, seven-level, and nine-level topologies rooted in this innovative approach. These topologies were propelled by a SPWM technique, with particular attention directed towards devising a switching pattern conducive to capacitor equilibrium and optimizing charging/discharging cycles throughout the operational trajectory. Reference [127] introduced the design of a symmetric multilevel inverter aimed at generating a higher output voltage range with a fifteen-level output. An open-loop and closed-loop control system has been employed to accommodate various operating load conditions, including resistive (R) and resistive-inductive (RL) loads. The proposed solar-powered inverter (SFI), regulated by sinusoidal pulse width modulation, demonstrates a reduction in THD levels. In multilevel inverters, practical application often faces challenges such as complex reference voltage synthesis, high CMV, and elevated switching losses. Overcoming these obstacles while improving the performance of system requires an innovative approach to SVPWM. To address this, a novel SVPWM scheme is proposed for PMSM vector control that is practical and independent of the level number used in the multilevel inverter. This scheme simplifies computational complexity and enhances PMSM performance. Initially, the space vector plane is subdivided, enabling direct determination of the coordinates and duty cycles of the nearest three vectors based on the reference vector's location. This process streamlines calculations and eliminates the need for iterative algorithms [128]. In the investigation [129], an independent PV system was analyzed, comprising a DC-DC boost converter and a two-level three-phase Voltage Source Inverter linked to a resistive-inductive load. The boost converter was integrated with incremental conductance (INC) control to optimize power extraction from the PV panel. Regarding the regulation of the VSI output voltage, PWM emerged as a prevalent technique. In efforts to enhance power quality, SHE-PWM and SVPWM methods were specifically employed and evaluated through simulations. To elucidate and compare the utilization of the DC bus in a three-level NPC inverter using the SVPWM and SHEPWM techniques, a analysis was undertaken focusing on their performance in the linear region of the Modulation Index. The paper [130] also presents an analogous relationship between the modulation indices in SPWM and SVPWM. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the THD is lower in the SVPWM technique compared to the SPWM technique study [131] presented a hybrid approach combining artificial neural network (ANN) and the Newton-Raphson algorithm (NR) for selective harmonic elimination in cascaded multilevel inverters tailored for PV applications. This methodology leverages the SHE-PWM technique to optimize and mitigate harmonic distortion within the inverter system, specifically targeting the reduction of THD. Additionally, the study incorporates the integration of a conventional boost converter to elevate the PV voltage to an enhanced DC-link voltage, thereby fostering more efficient operational performance. To provide a clearer understanding of the relative advantages and limitations of different modulation strategies for high-power PV systems, a comparative summary is presented in [Table 3](#tbl3):\n\n## 5.
