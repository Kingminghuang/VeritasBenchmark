Component complexity and cost\n\nMultilevel inverters require a greater number of components, including switches, capacitors, and diodes, to achieve higher voltage levels and reduce harmonic distortion. However, this increase in component count leads to greater design complexity and higher production costs [132]. In LS-PV-PP systems, where cost-effectiveness is critical, this complexity can pose significant barriers to adoption. Additionally, the need for precise synchronization among components can complicate the design and increase maintenance demands [133].\n\n",
