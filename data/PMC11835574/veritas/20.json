    "section_content": "### 5.2. Efficiency and power loss\n\nAlthough multilevel inverters effectively reduce harmonic distortion, they are not immune to power losses. Switching and conduction losses occur with each additional level, especially under high-power conditions typical of large-scale applications. These losses can reduce the overall efficiency of PV systems, particularly when scaled to industrial levels. Minimizing these losses remains a challenge, as it often requires a trade-off with increased complexity in control mechanisms or additional components [134].\n\n",
