Renewable energy and photovoltaic systems\n\nThe development and progress of large industrial entities, as well as broader societal advancements, are intricately intertwined with the generation and distribution of energy resources. Consequently, the establishment of robust mechanisms for large-scale energy generation is widely recognized as a pivotal determinant in fostering the evolution of contemporary societies. With the increasing demand for electrical energy and growing environmental concerns associated with fossil fuels, the need for a fundamental shift to a sustainable solution is deemed essential. Increasing investments in renewable energy resources have become one of the key global objectives due to climate change and environmental pollution [1,2]. With the aim of solving the existing challenges in the development of sustainable energy generation, significant efforts have been made in recent decades to develop and replace Renewable Energy Resources (RESs). In recent years, Distributed Energy Resources (DER) have witnessed substantial advancements with a primary objective of enhancing grid reliability, transitioning away from conventional grid frameworks, facilitating the assimilation of renewable energy sources, and conscientiously addressing environmental concerns [3]. Of these resources, PV systems have emerged as a frontrunner in renewable energy generation networks by efficiently harnessing the sun's radiant energy to generate electrical power. The growing significance and adoption of PV systems underscore a pivotal shift towards sustainable energy practices within the energy sector. [Fig. 1](#fig1) shows the general structure of a PV system and its main components including PV arrays, converters, loads and their connections. By the year 2020, the global photovoltaic solar capacity had increased to more than 627Â GW (GW), with projections indicating a trajectory of substantial expansion exceeding current thresholds [4].\n\n",
