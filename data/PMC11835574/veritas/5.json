Importance of LS-PV-PP systems and high-power inverters\n\nThis growth trend in solar PV capacity underscores a promising outlook for the future development and adoption of photovoltaic technologies worldwide.LS-PV-PPs are recognized as a sustainable and evolving solution for harnessing solar energy in high capacities. One of the reasons for the widespread adoption of LS-PV-PP is the advancement in power electronic technology and the reduction in the cost of components, modules, and cells, which has expedited the installation and deployment of a power plant within less than a year [5]. LS-PV-PP systems are comprehensive and suitable solutions for meeting the short-term needs of multi-megawatt demands, especially in off-grid regions. The design, installation, and commissioning of these systems take less than one year, while for a conventional power plant, this period increases to four years. The structure of an LS-PV-PP is shown in [Fig. 2](#fig2). PV arrays are depicted, and their modules are connected in series or parallel. In the structure of this system, the PV arrays are connected to DC/DC converters, and their outputs are connected through a common bus with a voltage range of 400–700 V. Then, a central DC/AC inverter is connected to a common DC link Subsequently, a central DC/AC converter is linked to a shared DC link, facilitating the transfer of AC power to the load [6].\n\nIn order to efficiently and fully utilize the received energy from solar panels in LS-PV-PP, high-power inverters play an important role in converting the received DC energy from the panels into AC power for supply the AC loads. In large-scale applications such as PV power plants, \"high-power\" in medium voltage (MV) inverters is characterized by the use of multilevel inverters to enhance efficiency and scalability. These high-power MV systems generally function within a power range of 0.4 MW–40 MW, and in certain applications, can reach up to 100 MW. The typical voltage range for these systems spans from 2.3 kV to 13.8 kV. In the context of PV power plants, the \"high-power\" classification for multilevel inverters usually applies to systems operating in the MW range, incorporating medium voltage levels of 2.3–13.8 kV to optimize energy transmission efficiency and support reliable system performance [7]. The evolution of semiconductor technologies has been very effective in the field of inverter challenges, especially the problems related to voltage fluctuations. This development shows a great achievement and provides users with more control and flexibility in using inverters [8]. In the structure of LS-PV-PPs, the inverter is considered as the main component of the generation and transmission system, which can control the generated power. In the common structure of LS-PV-PPs, a medium-voltage transformer is also utilized, resulting cost and weight increases. On the other hand, due to the size and structure of this transformer, the system will be shut-down when a fault occurs in either unit during the transfer to the central inverter.\n\n",
