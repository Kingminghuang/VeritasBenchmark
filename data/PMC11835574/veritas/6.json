Challenges in LS-PV-PP system design and operation\n\nWhile multilevel inverters provide improved power quality and reduced harmonic distortion, challenges related to component complexity, control demands, and thermal management remain. These challenges limit their adoption in large-scale applications, where cost and reliability are crucial considerations. A multitude of factors require meticulous consideration when designing an LS-PV-PP system. These include ensuring safe operational parameters, mitigating risks associated with overvoltage and overcurrent conditions, implementing galvanic isolation measures, and minimizing power losses within semiconductor devices. A particularly significant aspect of such systems involves the integration of efficient maximum power point tracking (MPPT) protocols tailored to the PV system. MPPT algorithms are critical in PV systems to ensure maximum energy extraction under varying environmental conditions. PV modules have a specific point on their power-voltage (P-V) curve, the Maximum Power Point (MPP), where power output is highest. Since MPP fluctuates with changes in sunlight and temperature, MPPT controllers dynamically adjust the system's operating point in real time to maintain optimal efficiency [9].\n\nWorking of the MPPT algorithms is an important element in PV systems to make sure maximum power extraction is done even under different environmental conditions. The maximum power point is the specific point on the current-voltage (C-V) curve where the module generates the highest current. Since MPP shifts with the radiation and temperature variations, MPPT controllers adapt the operating point of the system from the optimal one in real time to keep the efficiency as high as possible and thus a decrease in MPP loss. MPPT methods to enhance the PV systems are the most important ones grouped into four categories, namely, measurement-based, calculation-based, intelligent schemes, and hybrid methods. Measurement-based algorithms are based on direct parameter measurements with examples of the Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV) and the Short-Circuit Current (SCC) methods, which can be simple but may lead to a loss of accuracy in case of partially shaded PVs. Calculation-based algorithms expect the MPP through mathematics models, such as Perturb and Observe (P&O), which are simple but tend to oscillate around the MPP, and Incremental Conductance (IC), which makes a precise calculation of the PV curve slope, what is best under dynamic weather conditions [10]. Intelligent schemes, among which are Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC), Neural Networks (NN), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), are AI techniques that manage the nonlinear interaction between multiple PPS and the load to identify the global MPP, even if there is partial shading of the module. Finally, hybrid methods, the conjoint ones, for instance, FLC and P&O, that balance both accuracy and speed, often are the best in the utmost challenging conditions yet the need for higher costs and exertion of implementation are required [11].\n\nTherefore, high-power inverters, which has been introduced as a new technology to meet high-power industrial needs, are potentially used in LS-PV-PP systems to achieve these goals [12]. These converters are designed to receive high-voltage DC inputs from PV panels and regulate them to deliver the necessary output of AC voltage with an appropriate frequency for seamless grid integration via an advanced conversion system. High-power converters continuously adjust the voltage and current levels using MPPT algorithms to maximize the output power and ensure its high efficiency. In addition to LS-PV-PPs, high-power inverters are used in various applications, including large electric motors, Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices and renewable energy (RE) converters [13]. Also, these converters have recently been presented as a widely used technology to meet the needs and challenges in industries such as electric drives and rolling mills [14]. One of the highly important advantages of these inverters compared to classic inverters is the low voltage-stress and power losses, and improved power quality.\n\n",
