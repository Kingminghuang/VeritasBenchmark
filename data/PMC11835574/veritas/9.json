    "section_content": "### 2.1. Current source inverters (CSI)\n\nThe Current Source Inverter (CSI) topology employs a current source as its input. As depicted in [Fig. 4](#fig4), within the CSI configuration, the circuit's input is linked to a current source. Here, the DC input current undergoes conversion into high-frequency alternating current at the output, achieved through a high-frequency switching circuit. The advantages associated with CSI inverters encompass robust short-circuit protection and enhanced fault tolerance. These inverters find frequent application in scenarios demanding high levels of fault tolerance, notably in drive systems and for speed control in high-power motors [23]. Despite their advantages, CSIs typically demonstrate lower efficiency compared to voltage source inverters (VSIs), largely due to the need for multiple active components, such as large inductors and capacitors, to ensure steady current flow. This regulation process increases the complexity of control algorithms and introduces energy losses, making CSIs less suitable for large-scale applications where efficiency is critical [24]. This reliance on large inductors only increases operational costs and losses in terms of efficiency due to resistive heating and magnetic hysteresis. Furthermore, the increased component count and related maintenance requirements raise initial and long-term costs, thus placing a burden on remote PV installations, which need to be maintenance-free. Because of this, CSIs are seldom employed in cost-conscious PV projects that emphasize efficiency and minimal maintenance [25].\n\n",
