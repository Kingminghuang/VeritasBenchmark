  "research_plan": "<research_outline>\n- 1. Problem framing and objectives\n  - 1.1 Central dilemma\n    - Multilevel inverters (MLIs) reduce harmonics and filter burden, but under MW-scale PV conditions the cumulative switching and conduction losses erode overall efficiency.\n    - Loss-mitigation strategies (more voltage levels, advanced modulation, soft-switching, interleaving, SiC adoption) often add hardware, control, protection, and compliance complexity\u2014creating a design dilemma between performance optimization and practical implementation.\n  - 1.2 Research objectives\n    - Quantify how switching and conduction losses scale with topology, level count, device technology, and modulation across PV mission profiles.\n    - Map the efficiency\u2013harmonics\u2013complexity trade space; identify Pareto \u201cknees\u201d where added sophistication ceases to yield net benefit.\n    - Produce decision guidelines balancing efficiency, THD compliance, reliability, EMI, and cost/LCOE for high-power PV.\n\n- 2. Background and scope\n  - 2.1 Topologies\n    - Three-level NPC/ANPC/T-type (mainstream for utility PV), Flying Capacitor (FC), Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB), Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC).\n  - 2.2 Modulation/control\n    - Carrier-based PWM (PD/POD/APOD), SVPWM, discontinuous PWM (DPWM), nearest-level control (NLC/NLM), SHE, phase-shifted PWM (CHB), model predictive control (MPC); state redundancy for balancing.\n  - 2.3 Devices and switching ranges\n    - Si IGBTs (~1\u20133 kHz/device at MV/MW), SiC MOSFETs (higher fsw but dv/dt/EMI constraints), 3.3\u20136.5 kV classes (10 kV emerging).\n  - 2.4 PV grid context\n    - DC bus ~1\u20131.5 kV; MV interface via transformer; PCC current limits (IEEE 519/IEC 61000-3-6), interconnection (IEEE 1547/IEEE 2800, EN 50549), LVRT/FRT, reactive power support.\n\n- 3. Loss mechanisms and cumulative effects\n  - 3.1 Switching losses\n    - Per-event energies Eon/Eoff/Erec(Id, Vdc, Tj); Psw = fsw \u00d7 \u03a3E across transitions and devices.\n    - Influences: modulation (SVPWM vs DPWM vs NLM/SHE), dv/dt limits (EMI, insulation), gate-drive constraints, extra transitions for balancing/redundancy.\n  - 3.2 Conduction losses\n    - IGBT: Vce_sat \u00d7 Iavg; MOSFET: Rds_on(T) \u00d7 Irms\u00b2; diode/reverse conduction; topology-dependent conduction-path length increases with level count.\n  - 3.3 Ancillary/system losses\n    - Capacitor ESR heating (DC-link, FC/MMC), inductor copper/core, transformer, snubber/clamp, gate-drive/control power, cooling power.\n  - 3.4 Operating-point dependence\n    - Low irradiance: switching-dominated; high irradiance/temperature: conduction-dominated; reactive support and grid events shift loss distribution and thermal stress.\n\n- 4. How mitigation strategies increase complexity\n  - 4.1 Higher level count and componentization\n    - More switches/drivers/sensors/isolation; balancing components (FC/MMC capacitors); increased protection states and failure modes.\n  - 4.2 Control and balancing overhead\n    - Neutral-point/flying-cap control loops; MMC circulating-current control; computational load for SHE/MPC; interleaving synchronization and timing determinism.\n  - 4.3 EMI and dv/dt management\n    - Added common-mode chokes/filters; dv/dt shaping; spread-spectrum; layout constraints; compliance testing burden.\n  - 4.4 Protection/diagnostics and certification\n    - Fast fault detection, soft-shutdown, reconfiguration; firmware state explosion; verification and certification overhead.\n  - 4.5 Reliability and maintainability\n    - Parts-count-driven FIT increase; capacitor lifetime sensitivity; thermal hotspots; field service complexity and downtime risk.\n\n- 5.
