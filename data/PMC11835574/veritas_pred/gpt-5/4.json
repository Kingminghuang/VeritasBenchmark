  "question": "\nConsidering society's fundamental dependence on large-scale energy generation and the dual pressures of rising demand and the environmental unsustainability of fossil fuels, how does the strategic transition toward Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) explain the emergence of photovoltaic (PV) systems as a leading solution, and what does their rapid global expansion imply about the evolving structure and reliability of our future energy infrastructure?",
