    "section_content": "### Management and treatment strategies\n\nEffective management of metabolic syndrome is essential for reducing the risk of CVD and T2DM. This comprehensive approach includes lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, surgical interventions, and consideration of emerging therapies [35]. Lifestyle changes are foundational in managing metabolic syndrome. Dietary interventions are crucial, focusing on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Diets such as the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets are often recommended. Monitoring caloric intake is important for promoting weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight while limiting processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, and trans fats. Portion control and mindful eating practices can further support weight management and prevent overeating [36]. Physical activity guidelines suggest engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, such as brisk walking or cycling, along with muscle-strengthening activities two or more days per week. Increasing daily activity - such as walking more or taking the stairs - also contributes to overall health. Weight loss is critical, with a target of a 5-10% reduction in body weight, significantly improving metabolic parameters. Behavioral strategies, including goal setting, self-monitoring, and support groups, can aid in achieving and maintaining weight loss [37]. Pharmacological treatments may be necessary for managing specific components of metabolic syndrome. First-line insulin resistance and glycemic control treatments include antihyperglycemic agents such as metformin. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors also effectively lower blood glucose levels while providing cardiovascular benefits. Statins are commonly prescribed for dyslipidemia to reduce LDL cholesterol and lower cardiovascular risk, while fibrates can help decrease triglyceride levels and increase HDL cholesterol. Antihypertensive medications, including angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers, effectively manage hypertension and offer additional benefits for metabolic health [38]. In certain cases, surgical interventions may be appropriate, especially bariatric surgery. This option is typically recommended for individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher who have not achieved significant weight loss through lifestyle changes. Procedures such as gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding can lead to substantial weight loss, improved metabolic parameters, and a reduced incidence of T2DM and CVD [39]. Emerging therapies and future directions in the management of metabolic syndrome are promising. Research into novel pharmacotherapies targeting insulin resistance, inflammation, and lipid metabolism is ongoing. Personalized medicine approaches may tailor interventions based on genetic and phenotypic profiles, enhancing treatment efficacy. Additionally, the rise of digital health solutions, including apps and wearable technology, enables better monitoring of physical activity, diet, and metabolic parameters. Enhanced behavioral interventions, particularly those employing cognitive-behavioral strategies, may also improve adherence to lifestyle modifications [40].\n\n",
