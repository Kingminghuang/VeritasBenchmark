    "section_content": "### Pathophysiology and mechanisms\n\nThe pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome is intricate, involving multiple interrelated mechanisms contributing to its development and progression. One of the primary factors is insulin resistance, which impairs glucose uptake by cells and increases hepatic glucose production [1]. This results in hyperglycemia, prompting the pancreas to compensate by producing more insulin, leading to a condition known as hyperinsulinemia. Although this compensatory mechanism initially helps maintain normal glucose levels, it can eventually adversely affect lipid metabolism and blood pressure regulation [8]. Central obesity plays a crucial role in the development of metabolic syndrome. Excessive visceral fat accumulation is particularly harmful, leading to adipose tissue dysfunction. This dysfunction is characterized by an increased release of free fatty acids and pro-inflammatory cytokines alongside a decrease in the secretion of protective factors like adiponectin. Dysfunctional adipose tissue contributes to insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and hypertension, creating a vicious cycle that exacerbates the syndrome [9]. Dyslipidemia is another key feature of metabolic syndrome, marked by elevated triglycerides and low levels of HDL cholesterol. Insulin resistance impairs the ability of insulin to suppress hepatic production of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), leading to increased triglyceride levels. Concurrently, low HDL cholesterol levels are often observed, likely due to increased activity of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and reduced maturation of HDL particles. This dyslipidemic profile significantly heightens the risk of CVD [10]. Hypertension is also a common component of metabolic syndrome, largely driven by the interplay of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. These conditions stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, contributing to elevated blood pressure. Additionally, insulin resistance can lead to increased sodium reabsorption and impaired vasodilation, further exacerbating hypertension [11]. Pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic states are another critical aspect of metabolic syndrome. Excess visceral fat secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), contributing to a chronic inflammatory environment. This inflammation, coupled with insulin resistance, promotes a pro-thrombotic state by increasing plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and fibrinogen levels, heightening the risk of clot formation and cardiovascular events [12]. Finally, genetic and environmental factors play significant roles in the development of metabolic syndrome. Genetic predisposition can influence an individual's susceptibility to the syndrome and its components. Meanwhile, environmental factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy dietary habits, and chronic stress can interact with genetic vulnerabilities, further increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome. Understanding the complex interplay between these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies for metabolic syndrome and its associated conditions, such as CVD and T2DM [13].\n\n",
