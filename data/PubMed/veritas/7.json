    "section_content": "### Metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease\n\nMetabolic syndrome is a significant risk factor for CVD, with various mechanisms linking the two conditions. It contributes to atherosclerosis through several pathways, including insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Insulin resistance leads to dyslipidemia, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL cholesterol levels, promoting atherogenic processes [20]. Additionally, chronic low-grade inflammation associated with metabolic syndrome results in endothelial dysfunction, impaired vasodilation, and increased arterial stiffness, further exacerbating atherosclerosis. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α are common in individuals with metabolic syndrome. These cytokines contribute to vascular inflammation and damage, promoting the progression of atherosclerosis and increasing the risk of CVD events. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in metabolic syndrome leads to oxidative stress, which damages endothelial cells and promotes plaque formation in arteries. This oxidative environment can also modify lipoproteins, such as oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which are particularly atherogenic [21]. Individuals with metabolic syndrome have a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Studies indicate that the presence of metabolic syndrome doubles the risk of CVD events, including MI and stroke, compared to those without the syndrome [22]. The mechanisms include increased thrombotic risk, as metabolic syndrome is associated with a hypercoagulable state, increasing the likelihood of thrombus formation that can lead to MI or stroke. Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with metabolic syndrome experience higher rates of acute coronary syndromes and cerebrovascular accidents, largely due to the underlying atherosclerotic changes and endothelial dysfunction [23]. The link between metabolic syndrome and heart failure is also well-established. The syndrome's components, such as hypertension and diabetes, contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, ultimately leading to heart failure. The risk of developing heart failure is particularly pronounced in individuals with both metabolic syndrome and pre-existing CVD [24]. Numerous studies have demonstrated the strong association between metabolic syndrome and CVD. Research indicates that metabolic syndrome is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of CVD and a 1.5-fold increase in all-cause mortality. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is rising globally, paralleling the increase in obesity and sedentary lifestyles, which further compounds the risk of CVD. Long-term studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study, have consistently shown that metabolic syndrome is a strong predictor of future cardiovascular events, even in individuals without diabetes [25].\n\n",
