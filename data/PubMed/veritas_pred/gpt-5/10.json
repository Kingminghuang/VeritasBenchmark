  "research_plan": "Step-by-step plan (using available tools and team members)\n1) Use deep_analyzer_agent on the ORIGINAL TASK to decompose the research question, enumerate required dimensions (clinical framework, personalization, digital health, transformation mechanisms, outcomes), and propose the section structure.\n2) Draft a comprehensive, hierarchical research outline covering foundational concepts, the current continuum of care, transformation via personalized medicine and digital health technologies, evidence sources, evaluation methods, implementation, and future research.\n3) Review and refine the outline to ensure it meets the requested output format: clear, hierarchical bullet points embedded in a single XML element <research_outline>.\n4) Deliver the final outline via final_answer_tool embedded in <research_outline>.\n\n<research_outline>\n(1) Clarify scope, definitions, and conceptual framing\n- Define metabolic syndrome (MetS): diagnostic criteria (NCEP ATP III, IDF; 2009 Joint Interim Statement); components (central adiposity, dysglycemia/insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension).\n- Situate MetS within the cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome context to emphasize cross-organ risk integration.\n- Define the hierarchical management model: lifestyle foundation \u2192 targeted pharmacotherapy \u2192 metabolic/bariatric surgery.\n- Specify outcomes: prevention of T2D/CVD; MACE and mortality; HF and CKD progression; MASLD/MASH resolution/fibrosis improvement; durable weight loss; QoL; safety; cost-effectiveness; equity.\n- Define populations/subgroups: adolescents; older adults/frailty; women\u2019s health (PCOS, preconception); severe obesity; diverse ethnicities (e.g., lower BMI/waist thresholds in some Asian populations); CKD/HF; MASLD/MASH; OSA.\n\n(2) Map the current hierarchical continuum and its rationale\n(a) Lifestyle and behavioral foundation\n- Diet: Mediterranean/DASH; calorie restriction; low\u2013GI/low-carbohydrate (monitor LDL-C if very low-carb); cultural tailoring; adequate protein.\n- Physical activity: \u2265150 min/week moderate\u2013vigorous + \u22652 days/week resistance; reduce sedentary time.\n- Sleep optimization, stress management, tobacco/alcohol counseling; behavioral therapies (motivational interviewing, CBT); address social determinants.\n- Key evidence anchors: DPP (diabetes prevention); Look AHEAD (weight/QoL benefits, mixed MACE effects); strategies for weight maintenance and relapse prevention.\n(b) Targeted pharmacology by risk domain/comorbidity\n- Obesity/weight loss: GLP-1 RA (e.g., semaglutide 2.4 mg; CV risk-reduction label in obesity with established CVD), dual GIP/GLP-1 (e.g., tirzepatide); orlistat; phentermine/topiramate; naltrexone/bupropion (selection by phenotype/contraindications).\n- Glycemia/insulin resistance: metformin; SGLT2 inhibitors (cardio-renal benefits including in HF/CKD); TZD/pioglitazone (MASH benefit; risks: edema/HF, fractures, weight gain); alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (niche use).\n- Lipids: statins first-line; add ezetimibe; PCSK9 mAbs; inclisiran (LDL lowering); bempedoic acid (MACE benefit in statin-intolerant). Triglycerides: icosapent ethyl for TG \u2265135\u2013499 mg/dL on statin with high ASCVD risk (note negative outcomes with EPA/DHA mixes like STRENGTH).\n- Hypertension: ACEi/ARB, thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone/indapamide), CCB; combination/resistant HTN protocols.\n- CKD/HF: SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD/HF; finerenone in T2D with CKD; optimize RAAS/BP and lipids.\n- Liver disease (MASLD/MASH): lifestyle/weight loss first; GLP-1 benefits on steatohepatitis; pioglitazone in select T2D; resmetirom (FDA 2024) for noncirrhotic MASH F2\u2013F3 (monitor lipids/LFTs; statin dose considerations); noninvasive fibrosis assessment (FIB-4, ELF) and elastography.\n- OSA: CPAP for moderate\u2013severe OSA; weight-loss pharmacotherapy/surgery (tirzepatide reduced AHI in SURMOUNT-OSA).\n(c) Metabolic/bariatric and endoscopic interventions\n- Indications (ASMBS/IFSO 2022): BMI \u226535 regardless of comorbidities; consider BMI 30\u201334.9 with metabolic disease; ethnicity-specific BMI thresholds; adolescent criteria.\n- Procedures: sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, duodenal switch/SADI-S; endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty for selected patients.\n- Outcomes: durable weight loss;

MASLD/MASH (semaglutide histology, resmetirom pivotal); OSA (SURMOUNT-OSA); HFpEF (STEP-HFpEF).\n- Extract effect sizes on hard/surrogate outcomes and real-world adherence/safety.\n- Map interlocking effects: weight loss improves glycemia, BP, lipids, liver fat; organ-protective agents reduce events independent of A1c.\n\n(4) Analyze how the continuum operates in practice\n- Risk stratification/timing: use ASCVD/HF/CKD risk, hepatic fibrosis scores, obesity severity to set initial intensity.\n- Escalation/de-escalation rules: advance therapy for unmet targets or rising risk; de-escalate after durable control (e.g., \u226510\u201315% weight loss with stabilized A1c/BP/lipids for 6\u201312 months).\n- Monitoring/feedback: follow-up cadence (every 4\u201312 weeks initially), remote BP/weight logs, lab intervals; post-surgery and pharmacotherapy maintenance pathways.\n- Care coordination: standardized pathways, registries, navigation to reduce fragmentation.\n\n(5) Limitations/gaps in the current hierarchical model\n- Heterogeneous treatment response not captured by BMI/simple criteria.\n- Therapeutic inertia and episodic care; adherence decay over time.\n- Access/equity barriers (coverage, cost, GLP-1/GIP-GLP-1 supply; surgical access; lifestyle resources); cultural tailoring needs.\n- Data silos; lack of integrated cross-organ targets;
