I. Overall Conclusion
Plan B partially covers the research points of Plan A. While it addresses several key aspects from a strategic and evaluative standpoint, it does not explicitly cover all the domain-specific details and categorizations outlined in Plan A.

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis

Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A requires a clear definition of \"AI for Scientific Comprehension\" with an emphasis on its role in AI4Research and its two domains (textual comprehension and table/chart comprehension). In contrast, Plan B introduces two strategic thrusts—“external augmentation” and “internal autonomy”—which imply underlying conceptual frameworks but do not explicitly separate the domains as required by Plan A.
Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A calls for a survey of current approaches to textual comprehension, distinguishing between semi-automatic (with further subdivisions) and fully-automatic methods. Plan B discusses trade-offs related to external augmentation and internal autonomy, which indirectly pertain to textual processing but do not categorize techniques in the detailed manner prescribed by Plan A.
Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: While Plan A requires a detailed listing of techniques for table and chart understanding (e.g., data augmentation, chain-of-table, FDV), Plan B only contrasts approaches on highly structured data by discussing trade-offs for tables and charts. It does not list or describe the specific technical methods identified in Plan A.
Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A emphasizes a mechanism-by-mechanism analysis (including integration of external knowledge, self-reflection, and non-textual method conversion). Plan B, however, evaluates the strategies at a higher level by comparing the trade-offs of external augmentation versus internal autonomy without explicitly breaking down the underlying implementation mechanisms.
Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: The comparison of strengths and limitations is addressed in Plan A in terms of reliability, cost, and scalability for both semi-automatic and fully-automatic methods. Plan B analyzes trade-offs in terms of reliability, scalability, and inferential depth. Although similar criteria are used, the specific emphasis (such as cost in Plan A versus inferential depth in Plan B) differs and does not fully align with the detailed criteria from Plan A.
Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A concludes with frontier research directions and future challenges, including issues like long-context performance, multimodal integration, and mitigation of factual errors. Plan B, through its later points (specifically points 6 to 8), touches on tensions, conflicts, and proposes an integrated framework. However, it does not explicitly mention several key areas noted by Plan A, such as long-context documents or detailed challenges in multimodal integration.
III. Summary of Core Differences
Plan A focuses on a comprehensive survey and categorization of current methodologies by detailing domain-specific techniques and their respective implementation mechanisms. In contrast, Plan B takes a more abstract, strategic evaluation approach by contrasting external augmentation against internal autonomy, discussing trade-offs and proposing an integrated conceptual framework. This results in differences in specificity—Plan A offers granular details and categorizations, while Plan B presents a broader analysis centered on strategic trade-offs and integration rather than exhaustive technical enumeration.

Partially Covered   : 4 / 6 (66.67%)
Not Covered         : 0 / 6 (0.00%)

I. Overall Conclusion
Overall, Plan B provides a comprehensive yet restructured perspective on academic surveys. It effectively delineates the process of retrieval and generation, though its analysis is broader and less granular than the detailed, point-by-point evaluation outlined in Plan A.

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis

Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Fully Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan B clearly defines the two stages — \"Related Work Retrieval\" and \"Overview Report Generation\" — thus aligning well with the emphasis on establishing core concepts in Plan A.
Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Fully Covered
Rationale and Analysis: While Plan A requires a detailed categorization of retrieval paradigms, Plan B covers these by discussing semantic search, graph-guided approaches, LLM-augmented systems, and further expands into multi-agent methodologies. These points, although distributed across multiple segments, collectively satisfy the requirement.
Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A calls for an analysis of various levels within \"Overview Report Generation\" (from research roadmap mapping to section-level and document-level processes). Plan B mentions components such as research roadmaps and document-level surveys but does not distinctly address the differentiated techniques (e.g., extractive vs. generative at the section level).
Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: The requirement to compare agent-based survey systems with fine-tuning model approaches is not explicitly met in Plan B. Instead, Plan B focuses on retrieval strategies and their impact on survey generation without a direct comparative analysis of differing architectural approaches.
Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A emphasizes evaluating key challenges such as semantic relevance, coherence, and the handling of large-scale literature synthesis. In Plan B, while there is mention of improved contextual understanding and a strategic approach to retrieval, the explicit evaluation of these technical challenges is less detailed.
Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Although Plan B alludes to the evolving and co-dependent nature of retrieval and generation, it omits a thorough discussion on future challenges like ensuring factual accuracy, proper citation, and the seamless integration of retrieval and generation processes that Plan A stresses.
III. Summary of Core Differences
Plan A adopts a highly detailed, point-by-point framework focusing on technical categorizations and explicit evaluation criteria. In contrast, Plan B provides a broader narrative on the evolution and interdependence of retrieval and generation methodologies. This restructured approach in Plan B emphasizes process innovation and strategic insights over the granular technical comparisons specified by Plan A.

I. Overall Conclusion
Partially Covered

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis

Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A requires a framework covering five primary stages including a distinct \"Full-Automatic Discovery\" stage. Plan B defines a conceptual framework but only outlines four stages, thus omitting a detailed treatment of \"Novelty & Significance Assessment\" as a separate stage and a dedicated discussion on Full-Automatic Discovery.
Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A calls for a survey and categorization of current techniques with subdivisions for Idea Mining, Novelty Assessment, Theory Analysis, and Experiment Conduction. While Plan B discusses methods involving LLMs in early stages and details requirements for later stages, it does not provide the detailed classification or subdivided categorization as required.
Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A emphasizes a deep analysis of implementation mechanisms including prompting strategies, multi-agent system design, and feedback loop construction. Plan B touches on reconciling creative outputs with scientific validation but lacks in-depth discussion of the technical specifics and mechanisms (e.g., multi-agent simulation or specific prompting strategies).
Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Fully Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A requires a comparative analysis of strengths, limitations, and application contexts, particularly weighing fully automated versus human-AI collaboration. Plan B adequately addresses these trade-offs by discussing the creative yet unreliable outputs of LLMs against the rigorous demands of scientific validation and introduces dynamic human-AI collaboration roles.
Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A calls for an evaluation of integration maturity, assessing how the individual stages combine into a closed-loop pipeline with challenges like scientific rigor and interpretability. Plan B briefly discusses integrating feedback loops and bridging gaps between creative and formal approaches but does not fully assess the maturity of integration or provide a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation.
Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A demands a summary of frontier research directions and key future challenges. While Plan B introduces ideas about dynamic human-AI collaboration and iterative feedback, it does not explicitly identify gaps in current methodologies or outline detailed future research challenges as outlined in Plan A.
III. Summary of Core Differences
Plan A presents a more comprehensive and granular framework with explicit categorization of techniques, a deep dive into implementation mechanisms, and an end-to-end evaluation of integration and frontier challenges. In contrast, Plan B simplifies the framework by consolidating stages, focuses more on the role of LLMs and technical reconciliation, and emphasizes dynamic human-AI collaboration without elaborating on detailed categorizations or a thorough integration maturity assessment.

Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A requires a detailed survey of techniques across three phases, including specifics such as title optimization (PEGASUS-large), figure generation (FigGen), formula transcription, and citation recommendation. In contrast, Plan B’s point (2) outlines collaborative functionalities in preparation, writing, and revision in broader terms without naming specific tools or models, thereby lacking the detailed categorization of methods.
Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: While Plan A focuses on a deep analysis of key systems (e.g., \"AI Scientist,\" \"Agent Laboratory,\" \"Zochi\") with emphasis on multi-agent architectures and self-feedback loops, Plan B’s point (3) describes full-automatic systems by mentioning self-refining loops and multi-agent architectures. However, it does not explicitly discuss the specific systems or the depth required by Plan A, resulting in a less detailed analysis.
Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A calls for a comparative assessment of strengths and limitations, including manuscript quality, research integrity, efficiency, and human oversight. Plan B’s point (4) contrasts the roles of human oversight in different paradigms but does not fully address other dimensions such as research integrity or manuscript quality. Thus, while there is a comparison of oversight, other critical aspects are under-discussed.
Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Fully Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A focuses on evaluating the ability to appropriately manage citations. Plan B’s point (5) analyzes limitations in maintaining accurate citation practices and contextual accuracy. This directly corresponds to the evaluation of citation challenges and is adequately covered.
Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A requires a summary of frontier research directions and challenges such as system reliability, enhanced human-AI collaboration, and reducing the need for human editing. Plan B’s point (8) provides a comprehensive conclusion and discussion on the evolving scholarly practices, but it does so by expanding into broader implications without specifically addressing all outlined frontier challenges. Additional focus on the persistent need for human editing and detailed future research directions is missing.
III. Summary of Core Differences
Plan B adopts a broader and more generalized approach compared to the detailed and specific requirements of Plan A. It includes extra points (such as implications for scholarly integrity and authorship) that shift the emphasis towards broader research impacts rather than strictly technical analysis. In contrast, Plan A provides a structured and detailed breakdown with specific tools and systems, as well as a focused evaluation of techniques in each research phase.

Plan A emphasizes a detailed investigation of the core thesis of \"AI for Science,\" including how specific technologies (machine learning, LLMs, multi-agent systems) drive research automation and novel insight generation. Plan B, in contrast, broadly defines three scientific domains and the general role of AI but does not delve into how these technologies specifically accelerate discovery or automate research workflows.
Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
Plan A requires a survey and categorization of AI application areas across several specific fields (e.g., Physics, Biology/Medicine, Chemistry, Robotics, Software Engineering, Sociology, Psychology). Plan B aggregates these into three broad domains without mapping detailed examples such as law discovery in Physics, protein folding or drug discovery in Biology, materials design in Chemistry, or specialized applications in Software Engineering and Social Sciences.
Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
For Natural Sciences, Plan A asks for an in-depth analysis of specific AI models (e.g., PINNs in Physics, AlphaFold and multi-agent systems in Biology/Medicine, and robotics-integrated platforms in Chemistry). Plan B mentions simulation in physics and AlphaFold in biology but does not address key models like PINNs or detailed multi-agent frameworks, nor does it include the chemical/materials component.
Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
Plan A calls for a detailed investigation of AI applications in both Applied and Social Sciences, with specific examples (e.g., end-to-end vision-based control, sim-to-real transfer in Applied Sciences; multi-agent systems, AI-assisted interview tools, and AI chatbots in Social Sciences). Plan B covers Applied Sciences with a focus on control systems and code generation, and Social Sciences with sentiment analysis and social network modeling. However, it omits several specific examples and detailed mechanisms (e.g., ChatDev, MimiTalk, Therabot) that are central in Plan A.
Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
Plan A requires a comparative evaluation of the strengths, limitations, and maturity across various scientific domains, especially noting predictive reliability differences. Plan B offers a comparative analysis that focuses on the nature of data and the goals (prediction, control, explanation) in each domain. While similar in intent, it lacks the detailed evaluation concerning reliability disparities and maturity mentioned in Plan A.
Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Not Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
Plan A specifically asks for an evaluation of cross-cutting AI methodologies (multi-agent systems and LLMs) by discussing their roles in diverse tasks such as collaborative drug discovery, hospital simulation, and software development. Plan B does not address this cross-domain effectiveness or compare performance in these collaborative and domain-spanning tasks.
Regarding Point (7) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
Plan A outlines frontier research directions, such as developing fully automated research loops, enhancing human-AI collaboration, ensuring robustness (e.g., sim-to-real in robotics), and addressing ethical issues. In contrast, Plan B concludes with a general summary on the necessity of tailoring AI approaches to domain-specific challenges without touching on these key future challenges and specific research directions.
III. Summary of Core Differences
Plan B approaches the topic from a high-level, domain-aggregative perspective, whereas Plan A provides a granular, point-by-point exploration with specific models, examples, and challenges. Consequently, Plan B misses several detailed analyses, particularly in the areas of model specifics, cross-domain methodologies, and future research challenges, leading to only a partial overlap with the comprehensive scope of Plan A.

Partially Covered   : 3 / 6 (50.00%)
Not Covered         : 3 / 6 (50.00%)

I. Overall Conclusion
Plan B only partially covers the research points defined in Plan A. While it touches on aspects of the research lifecycle and highlights evaluation challenges, it omits several key details and mappings specified in Plan A.

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis

Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
Plan A clearly segments the research lifecycle into five stages (Scientific Comprehension, Academic Survey Generation, Scientific Discovery, Academic Writing, and Academic Peer Reviewing). In contrast, Plan B broadly categorizes aspects of the landscape (e.g., comprehension, discovery, writing, peer review) but does not explicitly address Academic Survey Generation or detail the segmentation as comprehensively.
Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Not Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
Plan A requires a systematic survey and categorization of available resources with detailed mapping (e.g., ScienceQA, SurveyBench, etc.). Plan B does not provide this inventory or mapping; instead, it shifts focus to the benefits of a task-specific approach without listing the specific resources and their correspondences.
Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Not Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
Plan A calls for an in-depth analysis of each resource’s methodology, including data sources, annotation processes, evaluation metrics, and core algorithms. Plan B does not delve into these resource-specific design details, concentrating instead on broader methodological tensions.
Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Not Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
The plan requires a comparative analysis of the resources based on several criteria (scope, task complexity, data modality, accessibility). Plan B, while mentioning the gap between isolated sub-task performance and end-to-end work, does not perform a detailed comparative analysis of the resources as required.
Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
Plan A expects an evaluation of the maturity and capability of AI applications across the research lifecycle. Although Plan B touches upon the limitation of high performance in siloed tasks and hints at challenges for end-to-end scientific reasoning, it falls short of a comprehensive evaluation of current maturity or a nuanced analysis of automation capabilities.
Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis:
Plan A requires a summary of research gaps and future directions including challenges like academic integrity and the development of autonomous “AI scientist” agents. Plan B addresses research gaps in evaluation metrics and presents emerging integrated frameworks. However, its focus is more on creating a conceptual evaluation model rather than explicitly outlining all additional challenges and future directions specified in Plan A.
III. Summary of Core Differences
Plan A is structured around a detailed, resource-specific inventory and comparative analysis of distinct research lifecycle stages, emphasizing clear mappings and in-depth resource evaluations. In contrast, Plan B adopts a more overarching approach by critiquing the effectiveness of current task-specific strategies and proposing integrated evaluation frameworks. This shift in focus leads to an omission of specific resource categorizations and detailed technical analyses required by Plan A.

Not Covered         : 2 / 6 (33.33%)

I. Overall Conclusion
Plan B addresses some key themes of Plan A from a higher-level, architectural perspective; however, it only partially covers the detailed points and implementation specifics outlined in Plan A.

II. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis

Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A requires an investigation into seven distinct areas (interdisciplinary models, ethics and safety, collaborative research, explainability, real-time experimentation, and multimodal & multilingual integration). In contrast, Plan B’s opening focuses on defining a unified system emphasizing interdisciplinary, multimodal, and multilingual capabilities. While ethics is later touched upon in Point (2) of Plan B, the explicit focus on safety, collaborative research, and real-time experimentation is not clearly delineated.
Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Not Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Point (2) demands a detailed survey of current mainstream techniques, including specific models and frameworks for each frontier (e.g., Foundation Models for interdisciplinary AI, Fairness-Aware Training for ethics, Collaborative AI Agents for collaborative research, etc.). Plan B does not provide a comparable listing or discussion of these existing techniques and frameworks.
Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Not Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Plan A calls for a deep dive into the implementation mechanisms behind each technique—exploring data heterogeneity, debiasing methods, human-AI interaction protocols, and the intricacies of both white-box and black-box approaches. Plan B instead introduces challenges related to causal explainability but does not engage in a detailed exploration of the operational principles or mechanisms for the techniques mentioned in Plan A.
Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: While Plan A requires comparisons of trade-offs (such as Performance vs. Fairness and Transparency vs. Performance), Plan B’s analysis of trade-offs is implicit in its discussion of causal explainability and system architectures. However, it does not explicitly address the range of trade-offs or comparisons (like data privacy vs. accessibility or capacity vs. coverage) that are highlighted in Plan A.
Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: Point (5) in Plan A focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of current frameworks, including issues like negative transfer, plagiarism singularity, and low-latency decision-making in real-time experimentation. Plan B briefly touches on the risk of a \"plagiarism singularity\" and the limitations of a monolithic system regarding real-time responsiveness, but it does not comprehensively evaluate other critical challenges such as negative transfer or cross-modal data integration difficulties.
Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:

Coverage Status: Partially Covered
Rationale and Analysis: The synthesis in Plan A emphasizes future challenges, including the need for standardized metrics, high-quality datasets, robust human-AI interaction models, and reliable hardware-software integration. Plan B concludes with an architectural comparison and a synthesis of potential futures for scientific AI, but this synthesis is more focused on choosing between architectural models rather than addressing the broader research directions and challenges defined in Plan A.
III. Summary of Core Differences
Plan A is structured to provide a comprehensive, detailed mapping of both current research techniques and their underlying implementations across multiple targeted areas. In contrast, Plan B adopts a higher-level view that prioritizes architectural models and inherent trade-offs, offering a more conceptual discussion rather than an in-depth technical survey. This shift in focus leads Plan B to omit several specific details and evaluative criteria that are central to Plan A’s ground truth document.
