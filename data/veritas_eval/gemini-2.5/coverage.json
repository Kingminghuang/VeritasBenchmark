    "evaluation_report": "I. Overall Conclusion  \nPartially Covered – Plan B reproduces the overall three-stage framework and touches on most thematic areas of Plan A, often in comparable or broader language. However, it omits several concrete elements (e.g., specific tools such as ContraSciView, Evise, P2P; contradiction‐detection category; standardized benchmarking), supplies only cursory technical detail where Plan A calls for deep mechanism-level analysis, and lacks an explicit, systematic comparative-performance study. Thus coverage is substantial but incomplete.\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A (Define thesis and three-stage conceptual framework):  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Introduction (1.1–1.2) offers a thesis re “re-evaluation of scholarly quality, human–machine partnership” and subsequently structures the outline into Stage 1 (Pre-Review), Stage 2 (In-Review), Stage 3 (Post-Review), matching Plan A’s framework.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A (Survey & categorize existing AI applications)  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Pre-Review: Plan B 2.1 (desk review) and 2.2 (reviewer matching) correspond, but names only generic capabilities; it omits concrete exemplars (Evise, AnnotateGPT) specified by Plan A.  \n    – In-Review: Plan B 3.1 (single-agent review) and 3.2.1 (multi-agent) align with “peer-review generation”; 3.2.2 covers “meta-review synthesis”. It never references a contradiction-detection family (ContraSciView) called out in Plan A.  \n    – Post-Review: Plan B 4.1 (predicting influence) and 4.2 (promotion/dissemination) map to HLM-Cite and P2P/SciTalk categories, but again without naming or describing those systems. Hence categories are present yet examples partly missing.\n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A (Deep technical mechanism analysis)  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    a. Reviewer matching – Plan B 2.2.1–2.2.2 mention analyzing content, workload balancing, COI avoidance, but do not describe expertise-vector modeling algorithms, latent topic modeling, or load-balancing heuristics in depth.  \n    b. Peer-review generation – Plan B explicitly breaks into “Single-Agent” (3.1) and “Iterative and Multi-Agent” (3.2.1), satisfying recognition of the three optimization paradigms; however, it offers no architectural or training-objective detail.  \n    c. Meta-review – Plan B 3.2.2 identifies AI-generated meta-reviews, yet omits discussion of argument extraction, synthesis pipelines, or conflict-view modeling.  \n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A (Comparative strength/limitation analysis across criteria)  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B sprinkles brief “Implications” under each subsection (efficiency, bias, black-box problem) but never delivers a systematic, metric-based comparison of different AI approaches on accuracy, scalability, or output quality.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A (Evaluate effectiveness on systemic peer-review challenges)  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Efficiency gains and workload reduction are mentioned (2.1.3, 2.2.3, 3.1.3). Concerns over bias, quality depth, and fairness surface (2.2.3, 3.1.3). Yet Plan B lacks quantitative or empirical evaluation, and does not directly tackle review-delay reduction or consistency metrics.\n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A (Frontier research directions & open challenges)  \n  • Coverage Status: Mostly Covered (with minor omissions)  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Section 5 and Conclusion discuss algorithmic bias, XAI, human-in-the-loop (“centaur”), and need for ethical guidelines. They also note new benchmarks indirectly (“develop more sophisticated and ethically-aligned AI”) but do not explicitly call for standardized evaluation datasets/leaderboards. Enhancement of generative-reasoning capability is implied (5.1.2) but not elaborated.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Granularity: Plan A specifies concrete tools, algorithms, and paradigms; Plan B remains higher-level and illustrative.  \n2. Depth of Technical Analysis: Plan A demands mechanism-level scrutiny; Plan B offers conceptual descriptions with limited architectural detail.  \n3. Comparative & Empirical Focus: Plan A stresses systematic performance benchmarking; Plan B provides qualitative “Implications” only.  \n4. Category Coverage: Plan B omits contradiction-detection systems and explicit standardized-benchmark discussion.  \n5. Perspective: Plan B broadens the conversation to philosophical redefinitions of scholarly quality and authorship, themes not foregrounded in Plan A."

    "evaluation_report": "I. Overall Conclusion\nPlan B provides a generally similar high-level flow (hypothesis generation → theory checking → experimentation → synthesis), but it does not exhaustively replicate the breadth and granularity of Plan A. Coverage is therefore only partial: many core ideas of Plan A are addressed, but important stages (especially “Novelty & Significance Assessment”), systematic taxonomies, mechanism-level details (prompt engineering, multi-agent debate, open- vs closed-loop labs), and an explicit maturity audit of existing systems are either missing or only superficially mentioned.\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A – Conceptual framework with five explicit stages  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Plan B’s §(1) defines “Full-Automatic Discovery” and recognises a “multi-stage” pipeline, then implements three concrete phases (Idea Mining, Theory Analysis, Experimentation).  \n    – It implicitly embeds “Novelty” inside Phase 1 (vector-based novelty score) but never isolates “Novelty & Significance Assessment” as its own stage.  \n    – Plan B omits an explicit, concluding “Full-Automatic Discovery” stage that evaluates end-to-end autonomy.  \n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A – Survey & categorisation of mainstream techniques  \n  a. Idea Mining  \n     • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n     • Rationale: Plan B covers LLM-based generation from external corpora and novelty scoring, and mentions ensemble methods and a human “creative curator.” It does not systematically distinguish (i) internal-LLM knowledge vs (ii) external signals vs (iii) AI-AI or human-AI collaborative generation.  \n  b. Novelty Assessment  \n     • Coverage Status: Minimally Covered  \n     • Rationale: Only a single bullet on vector-DB novelty scores. No discussion of traditional bibliometrics, LLM-augmented peer review, or hybrid human-AI scoring frameworks.  \n  c. Theory Analysis  \n     • Coverage Status: Largely Covered  \n     • Rationale: Plan B’s Phase 2 examines formal translation, theorem provers, and knowledge-graph consistency checks; includes a human “Logic Expert.” Evidence collection (e.g., RAG) is not explicitly cited.  \n  d. Experiment Conduction  \n     • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n     • Rationale: Plan B treats AI-driven design, Bayesian optimisation, robotic cloud labs, and real-time feedback. It does not map pre-experiment estimation tools or distinguish open- versus closed-loop lab control.  \n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A – Deep mechanism analysis (prompting, decoding, multi-agent debate, feedback loops)  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale: Plan B mentions ensemble methods and iterative feedback during experimentation, but says nothing about prompt/decoding strategies or synthetic multi-agent debate frameworks.  \n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A – Comparative strengths/limitations & trade-offs  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale: Plan B’s §(5a/b) contrasts creativity vs rigor and outlines a “centaur” model, touching on human-AI trade-offs. It does not systematically treat originality, reproducibility, scalability, cognitive bias, or idea homogenisation across techniques.  \n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A – Integration maturity & end-to-end capability assessment  \n  • Coverage Status: Weakly Covered  \n  • Rationale: Plan B comments on reconciling creativity and rigor but never surveys existing integrated systems, benchmarks their maturity, or analyse practical hurdles of pipeline coupling (scientific rigour, interpretability validation, etc.).  \n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A – Frontier directions & future challenges  \n  • Coverage Status: Moderately Covered  \n  • Rationale: Plan B §(5c) lists challenges (scalability, ethics, trust, transparency) and evolving human roles. It does not delve into gaps in present methodologies nor specify requirements for autonomous self-driving labs in detail, but directionally aligns with Plan A.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences\n1. Scope and Granularity: Plan A insists on five explicit lifecycle stages and a fine-grained taxonomy of techniques; Plan B collapses the stages to three and offers a narrative rather than a catalogue.  \n2. Mechanistic Depth: Plan A demands analysis down to prompting, decoding, multi-agent debate, and lab control typologies; Plan B stays higher-level, focusing on conceptual roles and illustrative tools.  \n3. Novelty & Significance: Plan A treats novelty assessment as an independent, multifaceted stage; Plan B only gives it cursory treatment within idea generation.  \n4. Integration Audit: Plan A calls for a systematic maturity review of existing end-to-end systems; Plan B does not perform this audit.  \n5. Perspective: Plan B foregrounds human-in-the-loop “cascading filters” and ethical roles, whereas Plan A maintains a balanced comparison between full automation and collaboration.\n\nOverall, Plan B captures the spirit of AI-assisted discovery but omits several critical survey, taxonomic, and low-level technical details demanded by Plan A."

    "evaluation_report": "I. Overall Conclusion  \nPlan B only partially covers the research points laid out in Plan A. It mirrors Plan A’s first objective (identifying lifecycle stages) and touches, at a high level, on maturity assessment and future directions, but it omits the bulk of Plan A’s required work: the systematic, resource-by-resource inventory, methodological dissection, and comparative evaluation. Moreover, Plan B shifts emphasis from cataloguing existing datasets/benchmarks/tools to arguing for new, integrated evaluation frameworks—i.e., it approaches the topic from a different perspective rather than fully reproducing Plan A’s agenda.\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A: Define the core stages of the scientific research lifecycle and where AI is applied.  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered (with minor terminological drift)  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B, Part II (a)(i–v), lists stages—Comprehension & Survey Generation, Discovery & Hypothesis Generation, Experimentation & Analysis, Writing & Dissemination, Peer Review—that closely match Plan A’s five stages (Scientific Comprehension, Academic Survey Generation, Scientific Discovery, Academic Writing, Academic Peer Reviewing). The substitution of “Experimentation & Analysis” for “Scientific Discovery” is a wording difference, not a conceptual omission.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A: Systematically survey and categorize datasets, benchmarks, and tools for each stage; build a comprehensive inventory.  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B promises to “systematically survey the current landscape” (Part II (a)) and offers scattered examples (CharXiv, SciBERT tools, unspecified drug-discovery platforms), but it neither (i) enumerates resources stage-by-stage nor (ii) maps them explicitly to functions as required (e.g., ScienceQA, SurveyBench, ScienceAgentBench, Writefull, PeerRead). The breadth and mapping rigor stipulated in Plan A are missing.\n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A: In-depth analysis of the methodology/design of each resource (data sources, metrics, architectures, etc.).  \n  • Coverage Status: Not Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B never drills down to dataset annotation schemes, benchmark metrics, or algorithmic architectures. Its focus remains on high-level critique (Goodhart’s law, integration gap) and proposed evaluation frameworks, leaving the methodological dissection untouched.\n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A: Comparative analysis of resources within each stage (scope, complexity, modality, accessibility).  \n  • Coverage Status: Not Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: No head-to-head comparison of existing resources appears in Plan B. There is only an abstract discussion of “siloed tools”; specific comparative criteria (general vs. domain-specific, text vs. multimodal, public vs. proprietary, etc.) are absent.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A: Evaluate maturity and capability of AI applications across the lifecycle (from isolated assistance to end-to-end automation).  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B criticizes “task-specific benchmarks” and highlights the “integration gap,” implicitly questioning current maturity. However, it does not systematically grade capability levels per stage or contrast isolated tools with end-to-end systems. The assessment remains conceptual rather than empirical, so only partial alignment exists.\n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A: Summarize research gaps and outline future directions (evaluation of complex reasoning, academic integrity, autonomous agents, seamless integration).  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B identifies gaps such as benchmark gaming, lack of integration, and difficulty measuring impact, and it proposes future evaluation frameworks (Scientific Turing Test, longitudinal projects). These correspond to some of Plan A’s envisioned directions (holistic evaluation, autonomous “AI scientist”). However, Plan B does not explicitly address academic-integrity mechanisms or seamless multi-tool integration; its future work concentrates on evaluation frameworks rather than tool unification.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Scope and Granularity: Plan A emphasizes a concrete, exhaustive catalogue and fine-grained analysis of current datasets, benchmarks, and tools; Plan B offers only illustrative examples and instead devotes space to conceptual critiques and new framework proposals.  \n2. Methodological Analysis: Plan A requires resource-level methodological deep dives and comparative metrics; Plan B omits these entirely.  \n3. Perspective: Plan A is descriptive and evaluative (what exists, how it works, how it compares); Plan B is prescriptive and argumentative (why current practice is flawed, how to redesign evaluation).  \n4. Outcome: Plan A’s deliverable would be a reference compendium plus gap analysis; Plan B’s deliverable would be a manifesto for integrated evaluations with prototype frameworks.  \n\nHence, while Plan B shares the high-level recognition of lifecycle stages and highlights certain gaps/future needs, it does not comprehensively cover the systematic surveying, methodological inspection, and comparative evaluation tasks that form the core of Plan A."

Overall Conclusion  \nPlan B offers a broad, historically-framed overview that captures the main skeleton of Plan A, but it omits or only lightly touches several technical details and comparative evaluations that Plan A explicitly requires. Coverage is therefore “partially covered.”\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s §(1) “Introduction” defines both “Related Work Retrieval” and “Overview Report Generation,” and states the automation goal. This matches Plan A’s request to clarify the core concepts and primary objective.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Semantic-Guided: Plan B §(2)(a)(i) lists “Semantic Approaches.”  \n    – Graph-Guided: Plan B §(2)(a)(ii) mentions “citation networks and co-authorship graphs.” However, entity-relationship graphs are not discussed.  \n    – LLM-Augmented: Plan B §(3)(a)(i) covers “LLM-Augmented Retrieval.”  \n    – Single-agent vs multi-agent vs deep-research subdivision: Plan B only discusses multi-agent systems (§4(a)), omitting single-agent and “deep research” categories. Thus the taxonomy is incomplete.\n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B explicitly lines up the three automation levels—“Research Roadmap Mapping” (Era 1), “Section-Level Related Work Generation” (Era 2), and “Document-Level Surveys” (Era 3). However, Plan A further asks for techniques distinguishing “extractive vs. generative” for the section-level stage; Plan B does not make that distinction, nor does it describe concrete techniques for each level.\n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Not Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan A calls for a comparison of agent-based frameworks (AutoSurvey, SurveyForge, STORM) versus fine-tuned models (Bio-SIEVE, OpenScholar). Plan B speaks generally about “multi-agent systems” but names no frameworks, offers no architectural comparison, and entirely omits fine-tuning model approaches.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Not Covered (very minimal)  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Apart from claiming that multi-agent retrieval is “highly comprehensive” (§4(a)(ii)) and that quality retrieval “constrains” generation (§5(a)), Plan B provides no systematic evaluation of semantic relevance, logical coherence, or complexity management across specific models.\n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A:  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s §5(c) “Future Outlook” predicts tighter integration and greater autonomy, echoing Plan A’s call for end-to-end agents. However, Plan B does not discuss factual accuracy, proper citation, or other listed challenges in any detail.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Depth vs. Breadth: Plan A prescribes a fine-grained technical taxonomy and comparative evaluation; Plan B delivers a high-level, era-based narrative.  \n2. Framework Comparison: Plan A demands concrete comparisons of named systems; Plan B stays generic.  \n3. Technical Specificity: Details such as extractive vs. generative techniques, entity-relationship graphs, single-agent pipelines, and fine-tuned model baselines are absent from Plan B.  \n4. Evaluation & Challenges: Plan A emphasizes empirical effectiveness, factual accuracy, and citation integrity; Plan B offers only broad assertions without metrics or mitigation strategies."

    "evaluation_report": "I. Overall Conclusion  \nPlan B provides substantial but not complete coverage of the research points laid out in Plan A. It captures the high-level intent (defining the area, distinguishing text vs. table/chart modalities, analysing mechanisms, and comparing paradigms) and even adds an integrated framework. However, several specific elements from Plan A are missing or only implicitly mentioned—particularly some taxonomy items (e.g., summarisation-guided reading, Chain-of-Table, FDV), certain evaluation criteria (cost), and explicit future challenges (long-context handling). Overall assessment: Partially Covered.\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\nRegarding Point (1) of Plan A: Define core concept, role in AI4Research, and two domains (textual vs. table/chart).  \n• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Introduction (§1.1–1.2) clearly frames “AI for Scientific Comprehension,” explaining the need to move from extraction to synthesis and listing text and structured (tables & charts) data as focal modalities, thus matching the two-domain requirement. It also positions the topic as advancing scientific discovery, which is adjacent to “accelerating AI4Research,” though the phrase and its ecosystem context are not explicitly spelled out.\n\nRegarding Point (2) of Plan A: Survey of mainstream textual approaches—Semi-automatic (Human-Guided, Tool-Augmented, Self-guided) vs. Fully-automatic (Summarisation-guided, Self-Questioning).  \n• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s External Augmentation (§2.1) maps to Human-Guided/Tool-Augmented; Internal Autonomy (§3.1) covers Self-Questioning. However, Plan B omits a discussion of “Summarisation-guided” methods and does not explicitly label “Self-guided” as a distinct semi-automatic subclass. The taxonomy therefore loses two leaf categories.\n\nRegarding Point (3) of Plan A: Survey of table & chart comprehension—Table (Data Augmentation, Chain-of-Table) and Chart (Dataset Development, FDV/structured representations).  \n• Coverage Status: Not / Minimally Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B (§2.2) mentions converting charts into formalised representations and using code interpreters for numeric analysis, but it never details specific research lines such as Data-Augmentation for tables, Reasoning-Paradigm Augmentation (Chain-of-Table), chart-specific dataset creation, or FDV representations. Thus most of Point (3) is missing.\n\nRegarding Point (4) of Plan A: Mechanistic analysis of each approach (RAG + verification, self-reflection, visual conversion).  \n• Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s mechanism subsections (§2.1.1, 2.2.1, 3.1.1, 3.2.1) explicitly discuss RAG grounding, use of code tools (verification), self-questioning / Tree-of-Thoughts (self-reflection), and chart formalisation—addressing all requested mechanisms.\n\nRegarding Point (5) of Plan A: Strength/limitation comparison (reliability, cost, scalability; dataset dependence for tables/charts).  \n• Coverage Status: Mostly Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s repeated “Trade-off Analysis” boxes enumerate Reliability, Scalability, and Inferential Depth. Although “cost” is not independently itemised, it is implicitly tied to scalability and HITL bottlenecks. Dataset dependence for structured data is briefly referenced (§2.2.1) but not deeply analysed. Overall, comparative intent is achieved but with some metric omissions.\n\nRegarding Point (6) of Plan A: Frontier directions—long-context handling, multimodal integration, hallucination mitigation, advanced autonomous reasoning.  \n• Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n• Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Future Work (§7.2) proposes multimodal extension and self-improvement (advanced autonomy). Reliability/hallucination is treated throughout via “Verification” loops. Nevertheless, explicit treatment of long-context document challenges is absent, and mitigation strategies for hallucinations are implicit rather than detailed.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Taxonomic Breadth: Plan A enumerates finer-grained subclasses (summarisation-guided, Chain-of-Table, FDV) that Plan B omits.  \n2. Evaluation Criteria: Plan A calls out “cost” and dataset dependence explicitly, while Plan B collapses cost into scalability and scarcely mentions dataset creation issues.  \n3. Future-Challenge Scope: Plan A highlights long-context processing; Plan B does not.  \n4. Additional Perspective: Plan B introduces a unifying “Grounded Autonomous Synthesizer” architecture not demanded by Plan A, reflecting a synthesis-oriented, system-design viewpoint rather than Plan A’s survey-comparison orientation.\n\nThus, while Plan B substantially aligns with Plan A’s high-level objectives and mechanisms, it falls short on several specific taxonomy items and frontier challenges."

    "evaluation_report": "I. Overall Conclusion  \nPlan B provides a broad, well-structured comparison of AI’s role in the natural, applied and social sciences, but it only partially covers the specific research points laid out in Plan A. Several Plan A items (e.g., multi-agent systems, software-engineering use cases, LLM-driven law discovery, closed-loop chemistry platforms, and explicit cross-cutting evaluation of multi-agent/LLM methods) are missing or only hinted at. Hence the coverage is best characterized as “partially covered.”\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A (Core thesis of “AI for Science,” with emphasis on ML, LLMs, multi-agent systems automating workflows across disciplines):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section 1.1 articulates a thesis about AI’s heterogeneous roles across domains, satisfying the “foundational understanding” portion. However, the specific enumeration and discussion of the three technologies named in Plan A—LLMs, multi-agent systems, and machine learning—appear only implicitly (“AI” in general). LLMs and multi-agent systems are never called out as distinct pillars or exemplified in automation of research workflows.  \n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A (Survey/map of goals & application areas: physics simulation/law discovery, biology/medicine, chemistry/materials, robotics, software engineering, sociology, psychology):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Sections 2–4 of Plan B do survey Natural, Applied and Social Sciences, and they cite AlphaFold (biology), collider data analysis (physics), materials science, robotics, economics, sociology and psychology. However, two Plan A areas are absent or marginal:  \n    – Physics “law discovery” via LLMs is not mentioned.  \n    – Software-engineering automation (e.g., ChatDev / code generation) is omitted.  \n    – Chemistry/materials is touched only briefly under Applied Sciences but without the chemistry-specific focus (no discussion of reaction planning or synthesis robots).  \n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A (Deep analysis of AI models/mechanisms in Natural Sciences)  \n  a. Physics: PINNs + LLM-based “AI-Newton”  \n  b. Biology: AlphaFold, DrugAgent, LLM “Clinical Brains”  \n  c. Chemistry: Closed-loop automated synthesis/characterization  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Physics: Plan B does discuss PINNs (Section 2.3) ⇒ covered. LLM-based law-discovery systems are absent.  \n    – Biology/Medicine: AlphaFold covered. No mention of DrugAgent-style multi-agent frameworks or LLM clinical assistants.  \n    – Chemistry/Materials: Only a single line on “accelerating discovery of new materials” (3.2) with no detail on closed-loop robotics.  \n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A (Detailed investigation in Applied & Social Sciences)  \n  a. Applied: vision-based control, sim-to-real, ChatDev for software engineering  \n  b. Social: multi-agent LLM social simulation, MimiTalk, Therabot  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Applied: Plan B addresses robotics control and sim-to-real (3.2, 3.3) ⇒ covered. It omits any mention of AI-driven software-engineering platforms such as ChatDev.  \n    – Social: Plan B covers sentiment analysis, misinformation modeling, voting prediction, mental-health text mining (4.2) but not multi-agent LLM social simulators, MimiTalk interviews, or therapeutic chatbots (Therabot).  \n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A (Cross-field comparison of strengths & limitations, especially reliability gaps):  \n  • Coverage Status: Largely Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B devotes an entire comparative table (Section 5) to contrasting domain-specific challenges, implicitly addressing maturity and reliability gaps (e.g., “non-stationary feedback loops” vs. “immutable laws”). While it does not explicitly quantify prediction accuracy, the qualitative disparity parallels Plan A’s requirement.  \n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A (Evaluate cross-cutting AI methodologies—multi-agent systems & LLMs—in diverse tasks):  \n  • Coverage Status: Not Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s comparative analysis is framed around three “core challenges,” not around particular AI methodologies. Multi-agent systems and LLMs are barely referenced; their cross-domain performance is never compared (e.g., collaborative drug discovery vs. hospital simulation vs. software development).  \n\n• Regarding Point (7) of Plan A (Frontier directions: automated research loops, human-AI collaboration, robustness/safety, ethics):  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Section 6.2 of Plan B notes future work on “hybrid AI methods,” “socio-technical systems,” and domain-specific ethical standards ⇒ covers ethics and interdisciplinary fusion. Yet it lacks explicit discussion of fully automated research loops, advanced human-AI collaboration frameworks, and detailed safety issues such as sim-to-real robustness in robotics.  \n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Perspective: Plan A is technology-centric (ML, LLMs, multi-agent systems) and application-granular; Plan B is challenge-centric (physical priors, sim-to-real, human bias) and much more abstract.  \n2. Focus: Plan A insists on concrete exemplars (DrugAgent, ChatDev, Therabot) and deep dives into implementation mechanisms; Plan B stays at the level of illustrative examples without entering algorithmic or system specifics.  \n3. Methodology: Plan A proposes systematic, domain-by-domain technical analysis plus cross-cutting evaluation of specific AI methodologies; Plan B offers a comparative narrative structured around domain-specific challenges, omitting detailed evaluation of multi-agent and LLM techniques and several application domains (software engineering, law discovery, closed-loop chemistry, therapeutic chatbots)."

Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A: Definition of the two paradigms  \n  • Coverage Status: Fully Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (1)(a) “Co-Pilot Model” and (1)(b) “Ghostwriter Model” map directly onto Plan A’s “Semi-Automatic” and “Full-Automatic” paradigms, clearly defining the human-in-the-loop versus end-to-end distinction.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A: Survey of semi-automatic techniques and models across three phases  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Phase a (Manuscript Preparation): Plan B lists brainstorming and outlining tools (Mindomo, Coggle, Zotero) but omits title-optimization research such as PEGASUS-large and structure-guidance methods.  \n    – Phase b (Manuscript Writing): It mentions generic co-authoring tools (Google Docs, Authorea, Jasper) yet ignores figure-generation (FigGen), formula transcription (ViT-based) and citation-recommendation systems (CiteBART, ScholarCopilot).  \n    – Phase c (Post-Revision): Plan B notes Grammarly and Word’s Track Changes, addressing grammar correction, but fails to discuss self-guided, human-guided (XtraGPT), or OverleafCopilot-style human-in-the-loop revision workflows.  \n    Hence only a general catalogue of common software is supplied; the research-oriented techniques and named models in Plan A are largely missing.\n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A: Deep analysis of “AI Scientist,” “Agent Laboratory,” “Zochi” and their multi-agent/self-feedback mechanisms  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (3) does discuss self-refining mechanisms (“AutoFeedback,” “Multi-Agent Debate”) and multi-agent systems (“AcademiCraft,” “AutoAgents”), acknowledging iterative improvement and task-specialised agents. However, it omits the specific flagship systems singled out in Plan A and does not detail their implementation mechanisms.\n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A: Comparative strengths/limitations (quality, integrity, efficiency, oversight)  \n  • Coverage Status: Largely Covered (Minor Gaps)  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (4)(a)–(c) contrasts human oversight, citation errors, skill atrophy, and ethics, capturing integrity and oversight dimensions. It references productivity implicitly (skill atrophy, enhancements) but says little about measurable efficiency gains or empirical quality metrics. Thus coverage is strong on integrity/oversight, weaker on quality/efficiency.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A: Evaluation of citation correctness across paradigms  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Section (4)(b) highlights “hallucinations” and “contextual inaccuracies” in both paradigms, recognizing citation issues. Nonetheless, it stops at qualitative remarks and does not provide a systematic capability evaluation of current frameworks, nor does it name any citing systems.\n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A: Frontier directions and future challenges  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis: Plan B’s Conclusion mentions “hybrid systems,” the “evolving landscape,” and “challenges of maintaining academic integrity,” touching on future outlook. It does not explicitly address improving reliability of fully-automated systems, enhancing collaborative workflows, and reducing residual human editing—all three called out in Plan A.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n1. Depth vs. Breadth: Plan A is model-centric and research-oriented; Plan B is tool- and concept-centric, offering a broader but shallower sweep.  \n2. Specificity: Plan A cites concrete research systems (PEGASUS-large, FigGen, AI Scientist, etc.); Plan B largely substitutes generic commercial tools or hypothetical frameworks.  \n3. Methodological Detail: Plan A seeks mechanism-level analysis (multi-agent loops, self-feedback algorithms). Plan B acknowledges such mechanisms but with limited technical exposition.  \n4. Future-Work Emphasis: Plan A enumerates precise research challenges; Plan B gestures toward them without detailing actionable research questions."

Plan B reproduces some high-level concerns of Plan A—especially ethics, explainability, and human-AI collaboration—and discusses several of the same trade-offs (e.g., transparency vs. performance, plagiarism-like risks).  However, it omits or only glances at a number of Plan A’s required frontiers (interdisciplinary-model mechanics, real-time autonomous experimentation, multimodal / multilingual integration), fails to enumerate the concrete techniques and benchmarks Plan A specifies, and provides far less detail on implementation mechanisms and quantitative evaluation.  Coverage is therefore incomplete and uneven.\n\nII. Point-by-Point Comparative Analysis  \n\n• Regarding Point (1) of Plan A (definition of six/seven frontiers)  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Plan B’s Introduction defines AI4Research and explicitly foregrounds three frontiers: ethical integrity, causal explainability, and human-AI collaboration.  \n    – It briefly references interdisciplinary, multimodal, and multilingual data in §1(a) but does not treat them as separate, in-depth research frontiers.  \n    – Real-time experimentation and agentic closed-loop labs are absent as explicit frontiers.  \n    – Thus only three of the six named areas (ethics & safety, collaboration, explainability) are substantively addressed; the rest are missing or only mentioned in passing.\n\n• Regarding Point (2) of Plan A (survey of mainstream techniques per frontier)  \n  • Coverage Status: Largely Not Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    a. Interdisciplinary AI – Plan B mentions “general-purpose models” but never lists foundation models, graph models, or their variants.  \n    b. Ethics & Safety – Bias mitigation is discussed, but no taxonomy of “fairness-aware training,” “training-free debiasing,” or monitoring benchmarks is provided.  \n    c. Collaborative Research – The term “federated ecosystem” appears (§6) yet there is no detail on federated-learning architectures or collaborative AI agents.  \n    d. Explainability – Transparency-performance trade-off is noted, but specific white-box vs. black-box methods are not enumerated.  \n    e. Real-Time Experimentation – Absent. No mention of self-driving labs or agentic real-time AI.  \n    f. Multimodal & Multilingual Integration – Bias in multimodal/multilingual data is mentioned, but pipeline engineering, terminology alignment, or performance equilibration are not surveyed.  \n\n• Regarding Point (3) of Plan A (deep mechanism analysis)  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Plan B analyses how bias may arise from multimodal/multilingual data (§2a) and the transparency-performance dilemma (§3a), touching the spirit of 3b and 3d.  \n    – It examines “real-time human-AI interaction” (§4a) which relates to Plan A 3c (interaction protocols).  \n    – Mechanistic treatments such as how foundation/graph models fuse heterogeneous data, the internals of white-box circuit analysis, or closed-loop robotics architectures are absent, so coverage is only partial.\n\n• Regarding Point (4) of Plan A (comparative trade-offs)  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Plan B directly studies “transparency-performance trade-off” (§3a) aligning with 4b.  \n    – It frames a “trilemma” intertwining ethics, explainability, and collaboration (§5), implicitly touching 4a (performance vs. fairness) and 4c (ethics vs. real-time collaboration) but without explicit treatment of privacy-accessibility (4c) or capacity-coverage in multilingual models (4d).  \n    – Therefore only some trade-offs are explored and not with the structured comparison Plan A demands.\n\n• Regarding Point (5) of Plan A (capability evaluation)  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – “Plagiarism singularity” risk is analysed (§2b) satisfying 5b.  \n    – Reliability of real-time decision-making (5c) is hinted at via “real-time human-AI interaction” but no latency or robustness metrics are evaluated.  \n    – Negative transfer (5a) and cross-modal data scarcity / uncertainty quantification (5d) are not addressed.  \n\n• Regarding Point (6) of Plan A (future directions & challenges)  \n  • Coverage Status: Partially Covered  \n  • Rationale and Analysis:  \n    – Plan B’s §7 offers a roadmap and open questions about future AI architectures, which aligns generically with Plan A’s call for synthesis.  \n    – However, it omits specific calls for standardized explainability/fairness metrics, curated multimodal datasets for science, engineered hardware-software stacks for self-driving labs, and robust human-AI coordination frameworks beyond interface design.  \n    – Thus forward-looking coverage exists but lacks the concrete items listed in Plan A.\n\nIII. Summary of Core Differences  \n\n1. Scope of Frontiers: Plan A enumerates six concrete frontiers; Plan B concentrates on three (ethics, explainability, collaboration) and leaves interdisciplinary modelling, autonomous experimentation, and systematic multimodal integration largely untreated.  \n2. Level of Technical Granularity: Plan A requires explicit catalogues of techniques (foundation models, fairness-aware training, federated learning, circuit-level explainability, etc.).  Plan B stays at the conceptual and strategic level without naming most techniques or benchmarks.  \n3. Mechanistic Depth: Plan A insists on implementation-level examination (heterogeneous data pipelines, closed-loop robotics). Plan B offers high-level discussion but few architectural or algorithmic details.  \n4. Comparative Framework: Plan A structures specific trade-offs (performance-fairness, privacy-accessibility, capacity-coverage). Plan B discusses one of these and frames a broader “trilemma” instead.  \n5. Evaluation & Metrics: Plan A calls for assessing negative transfer, latency, uncertainty quantification, and dataset scarcity; Plan B focuses mainly on plagiarism risk and broad governance considerations.  \n\nIn summary, Plan B captures the spirit of some of Plan A’s ethical, explanatory, and collaborative concerns but omits several essential frontiers, concrete techniques, and detailed evaluations, providing only partial coverage from a more conceptual, architecture-oriented perspective."
