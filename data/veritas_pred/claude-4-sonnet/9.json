  "question": "\nGiven the proliferation of specialized datasets, benchmarks, and tools designed to enhance AI's role across the scientific research lifecycle\u2014from initial comprehension and survey generation to discovery, writing, and peer review\u2014how does this task-specific approach to resource development create a fundamental tension between advancing AI capabilities on discrete, measurable sub-problems and holistically assessing an AI's capacity for genuine, end-to-end scientific advancement, and what new integrated evaluation frameworks would be necessary to bridge the gap between performance on these siloed benchmarks and a true measure of authentic scientific contribution?\n",

bridge the assessment gap:\n    (a) Develop multi-scale assessment architecture spanning micro (task-level), meso (workflow-level), macro (project-level), and meta (paradigm-level) evaluation\n    (b) Create longitudinal research simulation environments that track complete research lifecycles from problem identification to publication impact\n    (c) Design authentic discovery metrics that measure genuine novelty, paradigm-shifting insights, and cross-disciplinary synthesis\n    (d) Establish collaborative intelligence evaluation protocols assessing human-AI team performance and knowledge transfer effectiveness\n    (e) Develop emergent capability assessment methods measuring synergistic performance beyond individual task summation\n\n(6) Propose implementation strategies for transitioning from siloed to integrated evaluation:\n    (a) Design hybrid benchmarking approaches that maintain task-specific metrics while adding inter-task coherence assessment\n    (b) Create
