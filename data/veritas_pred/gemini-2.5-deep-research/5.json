  "question": "\nConsidering the proposed progression from AI-driven \"Idea Mining\" and \"Novelty Assessment\" to \"Theory Analysis\" and \"Scientific Experiment Conduction,\" how can a \"Full-Automatic Discovery\" system effectively reconcile the creative, probabilistic, and sometimes biased nature of LLMs used for hypothesis generation with the stringent requirements for logical consistency, empirical verification, and reproducibility in the later stages, while simultaneously managing the evolving role of human-AI collaboration across the entire research lifecycle to ensure the final discoveries are both novel and scientifically valid?\n",
  "research_plan": "\n(1) Define the conceptual framework of a \"Full-Automatic Discovery\" system, outlining the distinct functions of its four proposed stages: Idea Mining, Novelty Assessment, Theory Analysis, and Scientific Experiment Conduction.\n(2) Analyze the role of LLMs in the initial stages (Idea Mining, Novelty Assessment). Detail their strengths in generating creative hypotheses from vast datasets and their inherent weaknesses, such as probabilistic reasoning, potential for bias, and lack of grounding.\n(3) Detail the stringent requirements of the later stages (Theory Analysis, Experiment Conduction), focusing on the need for logical consistency, causal reasoning, empirical verification, and reproducibility as cornerstones of the scientific method.\n(4) Identify the core challenge: reconciling the creative but unreliable outputs of LLMs with the rigorous, systematic demands of formal scientific validation.\n(5) Investigate technical mechanisms for bridging this gap. Research approaches like neuro-symbolic systems (combining LLMs with formal logic), automated fact-checking against knowledge bases, and AI-driven simulation environments for pre-experimental validation.\n(6) Propose a model for dynamic human-AI collaboration across the research lifecycle. Define the evolving human role: from 'creative director' in hypothesis generation, to 'critical reviewer' in theory analysis, and 'ethical overseer' in experimentation.\n(7) Explore how feedback loops can be integrated into the system. For example, how the results from the empirical verification stage can be used to refine the initial LLM-generated hypotheses, creating an iterative cycle of discovery.\n(8) Synthesize these elements into a cohesive operational model for a \"Full-Automatic Discovery\" system that leverages the strengths of both AI and human intelligence to ensure the final discoveries are both novel and scientifically valid.\n"
