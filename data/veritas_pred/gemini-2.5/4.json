  "research_plan": "<research_outline>\n(1) **Introduction: The Two-Stage Process of AI for Academic Survey**\n    (a) Define \"Related Work Retrieval\": The process of identifying and collecting relevant scholarly literature.\n    (b) Define \"Overview Report Generation\": The process of synthesizing the retrieved literature into a coherent summary or a full survey document.\n    (c) State the central thesis: The evolution of retrieval methodologies is the primary driver enabling greater complexity and autonomy in report generation.\n\n(2) **Era 1: Foundational Methods and Their Impact on Early-Stage Report Generation**\n    (a) **Developments in Related Work Retrieval:**\n        (i) *Semantic Approaches*: Moving beyond keywords to understand conceptual similarity using techniques like term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), topic modeling, and early word embeddings.\n        (ii) *Graph-Guided Approaches*: Utilizing citation networks and co-authorship graphs to identify influential papers and research communities, establishing connections between works.\n    (b) **Shaping of Overview Report Generation:**\n        (i) *Capabilities*: These retrieval methods provided a structured list of relevant papers and their interconnections.\n        (ii) *Generated Output*: The complexity of the report was limited to **\"Research Roadmap Mapping.\"** This involved creating visual graphs or hierarchical lists that clustered research themes and highlighted seminal works.\n        (iii) *Limitation*: The output was a structural scaffold, not a narrative. It required significant human effort to synthesize the content of the papers into a story.\n\n(3) **Era 2: The LLM Revolution and the Dawn of Automated Synthesis**\n    (a) **Developments in Related Work Retrieval:**\n        (i) *LLM-Augmented Retrieval*: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the nuances of natural language queries and the deep semantic content of papers (e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation - RAG).\n        (ii) *Shift in Focus*: The process evolved from retrieving *documents* to retrieving specific *information, claims, and arguments* within those documents.\n    (b) **Shaping of Overview Report Generation:**\n        (i) *Capabilities*: With a deeper understanding of the source material, the generation stage could now perform more advanced synthesis.\n        (ii) *Generated Output*: This enabled the creation of **\"Section-Level Related Work Generation\"** and detailed analytical summaries. AI could now group findings, compare methodologies, and generate cohesive paragraphs or sections for a human to review and edit.\n        (iii) *Advancement*: This marked the transition from providing a simple structure to actively participating in the content creation process.\n\n(4) **Era 3: Multi-Agent Systems and the Pursuit of Full Autonomy**\n    (a) **Developments in Related Work Retrieval:**\n        (i) *Multi-Agent Systems*: Deploying multiple specialized AI agents that collaborate on the retrieval task (e.g., agents for query formulation, searching different databases, filtering, re-ranking, and extracting specific data points).\n        (ii) *Key Benefit*: This approach ensures a highly comprehensive, accurate, and reliable body of retrieved knowledge, minimizing gaps and errors.\n    (b) **Shaping of Overview Report Generation:**\n        (i) *Capabilities*: The high-fidelity knowledge base provided by multi-agent retrieval is the critical prerequisite for full automation.\n        (ii) *Generated Output*: This directly enables the **\"Autonomous Creation of Entire Document-Level Surveys.\"** The generative system can now confidently build upon the retrieved knowledge to draft entire documents, complete with an introduction, logically structured thematic sections, critical analysis, identification of research gaps, and a synthesized conclusion.\n        (iii) *Self-Sufficiency*: Advanced systems incorporate reflective agents that can critique and refine the generated drafts, mimicking the iterative human writing and editing process.\n\n(5) **Conclusion: The Symbiotic Evolution**\n    (a) **Synthesize the Core Relationship**: The scope of \"Overview Report Generation\" is fundamentally constrained and defined by the quality and depth of the \"Related Work Retrieval\" stage.\n    (b) **Summarize the Evolutionary Path**: The journey from retrieving a list of *documents* to extracting and structuring a comprehensive *knowledge base* is the key driver.\n    (c) **Future Outlook**: The increasing integration and synergy between these two stages will continue to push the boundaries of AI-driven research, leading to more powerful, nuanced, and autonomous academic survey tools.\n</research_outline>",
