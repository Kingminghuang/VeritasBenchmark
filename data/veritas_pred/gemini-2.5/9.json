  "research_plan": "<research_outline>\n    (1) **Introduction: The Central Tension**\n        (a) Define the core problem: The proliferation of specialized AI datasets, benchmarks, and tools (e.g., for literature review, data analysis, hypothesis generation) creates a conflict between optimizing AI for narrow, measurable tasks and fostering genuine, end-to-end scientific intelligence.\n        (b) Thesis Statement: Argue that this task-specific approach, while advancing capabilities on discrete sub-problems, hinders the holistic assessment of AI's true capacity for scientific contribution, necessitating new integrated evaluation frameworks.\n\n    (2) **Part I: The Landscape of Siloed AI Development in Science**\n        (a) **Mapping the Ecosystem:** Systematically survey the current landscape of AI tools across the scientific research lifecycle.\n            (i) **Comprehension & Survey Generation:** Tools for summarizing literature, identifying research gaps, and understanding complex papers (e.g., CharXiv, SciBERT-based tools).\n            (ii) **Discovery & Hypothesis Generation:** AI platforms for data mining, pattern recognition, and proposing novel hypotheses (e.g., tools for drug discovery, materials science).\n            (iii) **Experimentation & Analysis:** AI-driven tools for designing experiments, analyzing data, and automating lab procedures.\n            (iv) **Writing & Dissemination:** AI assistants for drafting manuscripts, checking for clarity, and formatting for publication.\n            (v) **Peer Review:** AI tools to assist in finding suitable reviewers, checking for methodological soundness, and identifying plagiarism.\n\n    (3) **Part II: Analyzing the Fundamental Tension: The Limitations of a Task-Specific Approach**\n        (a) **The \"Goodhart's Law\" Effect:** Investigate how focusing on narrow benchmarks leads to AI systems that are optimized to \"game the test\" rather than embodying genuine scientific understanding.\n        (b) **The \"Integration Gap\":** Analyze how siloed tools fail to replicate the iterative and interconnected nature of real scientific work, where insights from one stage must inform and adapt others.\n        (c) **Ignoring the \"Messy Middle\":** Discuss the failure of clean, well-defined benchmarks to evaluate an AI's ability to handle the ambiguity, intuition, and iterative troubleshooting inherent in the scientific process.\n        (d) **Throughput vs. Impact:** Contrast the ease of measuring an AI's output (e.g., number of hypotheses generated) with the difficulty of measuring the actual quality, novelty, and impact of its contributions.\n\n    (4) **Part III: Bridging the Gap: The Imperative for Integrated Evaluation Frameworks**\n        (a) **Defining the Goal:** Articulate the need for evaluation frameworks that measure an AI's ability to contribute cohesively to the authentic, end-to-end process of scientific discovery.\n        (b) **Survey of Proposed and Emerging Frameworks:**\n            (i) **HELIOS (Hybrid Evaluation of Lifecycle and Impact of Outstanding Science):** Analyze its approach to assessing the entire lifecycle and real-world impact beyond just technical performance.\n            (ii) **SciHorizon:** Examine its methodology for evaluating both the AI models and the quality/FAIRness of the data they use, promoting a more holistic view.\n            (iii) **EAIRA (Evaluating AI models as scientific Research Assistants):** Detail its multifaceted approach that mimics real-world scientific workflows, from factual recall to researcher-AI interaction dynamics.\n\n    (5) **Part IV: Designing the Next Generation of Evaluation Frameworks**\n        (a) **Proposal for a \"Scientific Turing Test\":**\n            (i) Outline a framework where an AI's research output (from hypothesis to full paper) is judged by human experts against human-generated research, with an emphasis on novelty, rigor, and insight.\n            (ii) Include an adversarial component where the AI must defend its methodology and conclusions against expert critique.\n        (b) **Proposal for a Longitudinal \"Research Project\" Evaluation:**\n            (i) Design a long-term evaluation where an AI is tasked with addressing a complex, open-ended research question over an extended period.\n            (ii) Define metrics to assess its ability to independently formulate sub-problems, adapt its strategy based on new findings, and integrate information from diverse sources.\n        (c) **Key Characteristics of a Holistic Framework:** Synthesize the essential components required for a true measure of scientific contribution.\n            (i) **Technical Performance:** Accuracy, reliability, and efficiency.\n            (ii) **Interdisciplinary & Integration Capability:** Ability to connect concepts across fields and integrate different stages of the research lifecycle.\n            (iii) **Human-AI Collaboration (\"Force Multiplier\" Effect):** How effectively does the AI augment and enhance the capabilities of a human researcher?\n            (iv) **Ethical & Responsible Conduct:** Adherence to principles of scientific integrity.\n            (v) **Sustainability & Practicality:** Real-world usability and integration into existing scientific workflows.\n\n    (6) **Conclusion: Shifting from Local Optimization to Global Scientific Capability**\n        (a) Summarize the argument that the current paradigm of AI development for science is at a critical juncture.\n        (b) Reiterate the necessity of moving beyond fragmented, task-specific benchmarks.\n        (c) Conclude with a call to action for the research community to collaboratively develop and adopt integrated evaluation frameworks to guide the creation of AI that can act as a true partner in scientific advancement.\n</research_outline>",
