  "question": "\nGiven that the advancement of AI for scientific comprehension hinges on two distinct strategic thrusts\u2014one focused on augmenting models with external guidance and structured inputs (such as human-in-the-loop systems, tool-use, and formalized representations for tables and charts) and the other on cultivating internal, autonomous capabilities (like self-questioning and novel reasoning paradigms)\u2014how do the fundamental trade-offs between reliability, scalability, and inferential depth manifest differently when applying these \"external augmentation\" versus \"internal autonomy\" strategies to the unique challenges of processing unstructured scientific text compared to highly structured tables and charts, and what integrated approach could best resolve these tensions to create a system that moves beyond mere information extraction to achieve genuine scientific synthesis?\n",
  "research_plan": "<research_outline>\n- (A) Detailed project plan (tools & team members explicitly incorporated)\n  - Step 0 \u2014 Project setup (planning_tool):\n    - Create and maintain a short execution plan and track progress with planning_tool (plan_id: plan_ai_science_tradeoffs_001). Deliverable: plan document, schedule, acceptance criteria.\n    - Team members: project lead (coordinates), ML researcher (internal reasoning), systems engineer (tool integration), data engineer (parsers), annotators / domain scientists (human-in-the-loop reviewers).\n  - Step 1 \u2014 Rapid literature harvest (web_search_agent):\n    - Use web_search_agent with the ORIGINAL TASK verbatim to collect top-level sources: review articles, recent influential papers, benchmarks, authoritative blog posts that cover \"external augmentation\" (tool-use, human-in-loop, structured inputs) and \"internal autonomy\" (CoT, self-questioning, PAL, ReAct, Toolformer) for both modalities.\n    - Deliverable: ranked_sources_list (URL + one-line summary) and short findings_summary.\n  - Step 2 \u2014 Deep collection (deep_researcher_agent) \u2014 conditional if gaps found:\n    - Use deep_researcher_agent with ORIGINAL TASK to gather full-text PDFs, repos, datasets (TaPas/TAPEX, TabFact, ChartQA, PlotQA), and extract implementation details and benchmark numbers.\n    - Deliverable: annotated_bibliography.json, gap_analysis.md.\n  - Step 3 \u2014 Synthesis & design (deep_analyzer_agent):\n    - Use deep_analyzer_agent with ORIGINAL TASK + collected sources to synthesize trade-offs across reliability, scalability, inferential depth for unstructured text vs structured tables/charts.\n    - Produce: synthesis.md (cost/benefit matrix), candidate Declarative Intermediate Representation (DIR) schema, and 3 candidate Reasoning Orchestrator policies.\n  - Step 4 \u2014 Prototype & verification (systems engineer + ML researcher + domain experts):\n    - Implement parsers, DIR, orchestrator policy, internal reasoner, and tool execution stack. Run benchmarks and human-in-the-loop evaluations. Iterate.\n  - Step 5 \u2014 Final deliverable (final_answer_tool):\n    - Output formal research outline, evaluation plan, and recommended integrated architecture.\n\n- (B) Execution log and rationale (what I did to produce this outline)\n  - I began by designing the plan above (explicitly referencing planning_tool, web_search_agent, deep_researcher_agent, deep_analyzer_agent, final_answer_tool and team roles).\n  - A rapid web search phase (web_search_agent) was executed and provided a concise summary of the main trade-offs (external augmentation vs internal autonomy), which I used as the primary synthesis seed.\n  - Where deeper source-level provenance would be required for implementation, the plan lists runs of deep_researcher_agent and deep_analyzer_agent; those are the next actionable steps for a research team to produce provenance-backed artifacts.\n\n- (C) High-level research goals\n  - G1: Precisely characterize how reliability, scalability, and inferential depth trade-off under two strategies \u2014 external augmentation vs internal autonomy \u2014 separately for unstructured scientific text and for structured tables/charts.\n  - G2: Design an adaptable, provable architecture that merges internal reasoning and external verification to enable scientifically faithful synthesis (beyond extraction).\n  - G3: Evaluate and quantify gains in faithfulness and depth, and measure human oversight cost.\n\n- (D) Core research questions to answer\n  - Q1: For which classes of claims (numeric, causal, methodological) does external augmentation yield deterministically higher reliability than internal autonomy, and at what operational cost?\n  - Q2: How does the inferential depth (creative, abductive, multi-hop synthesis) achievable by internal autonomy compare to that achievable by augmentation-driven pipelines augmented with symbolic modules and knowledge graphs?\n  - Q3: What orchestration policy (uncertainty thresholds, task selectors) optimally trades compute/human cost and desired confidence across modalities?\n  - Q4: Which Declarative Intermediate Representations (DIRs) effectively unify evidence across text, tables, and charts to enable deterministic verification for computable subclaims?\n\n- (E) Literature directions & prioritized pointers (starting reading list \u2014 include benchmarks/systems to target)\n  - Foundational methods (internal autonomy / reasoning):\n    - Chain-of-Thought reasoning (Wei et al.) \u2014 multi-step latent reasoning enabling depth but requiring calibration.\n    - Program-Aided Language models (PAL) \u2014 model outputs small executable programs for verification.\n    - ReAct (Yao et al.) and Toolformer / Tool-Augmented LMs \u2014 frameworks combining reasoning and tool calls.\n  - External augmentation / tool-use & human-in-loop:\n    - Tool-augmented LMs and human-in-the-loop verification patterns (Toolformer, WebGPT-like approaches).\n  - Table & chart-specific work:\n    - TaPas, TAPEX \u2014 table QA / table representation models.\n    - TabFact \u2014 table-based fact verification benchmark.\n    - ChartQA and PlotQA \u2014 chart/plot question answering datasets.\n  - Cross-document scientific synthesis & corpora:\n    - S2ORC, PubMed Central Open Access subset, CORD-19 (historical), domain-specific systematic review pipelines.\n  - Verification / faithfulness evaluation:\n    - Work on factuality, calibration, and self-consistency (self-verification, majority-vote chain sampling).\n  - Practical systems & agent paradigms to inspect:\n    - Toolformer, ReAct, PAL, WebGPT, and agentic retrieval-augmented generation systems.\n\n- (F) Technical decomposition \u2014 modules and responsibilities\n  - 1. Input Normalizer & Multimodal Parser (data engineer)\n    - Table/Chart stack: table extraction (structured CSV/JSON), chart object detection + data extraction (plot de-embedding), unit normalization, uncertainty metadata.\n    - Text stack: sentence segmentation, claim detection, numeric result extraction, methods & protocol tagging, citation parsing.\n    - Deliverable: raw parsed objects + provenance pointers to source spans and image coordinates.\n  - 2. Declarative Intermediate Representation (DIR) (ML researcher + data engineer)\n    - Unified, typed representations for facts: assertion triples (subject, predicate, object), numeric records (value, unit, distribution), executable fragments (SQL/analysis scripts, statistical-test specs), and provenance links.\n    - DIR must be designed for executability: small code fragments, queries, or formulas that can be run by the tool layer.\n  - 3. Reasoning Orchestrator / Policy (ML researcher + systems engineer)\n    - Decision policy that chooses: internal reasoning (LM latent chains), tool execution (statistical engine, symbolic solver), retrieval to KB/corpus, or human escalation.\n    - Policy inputs: uncertainty score, claim type (numeric vs textual), novelty score, expected cost, and criticality.\n    - Candidate policies: (a) conservative: prefer tool-verification for any numeric claim; (b) adaptive: default internal synthesis, selective verification on numeric/causal claims; (c) budget-aware: optimize for human-review budget.\n  - 4. Internal Reasoner (ML researcher)\n    - Constrained chain-of-thought that emits DIR-compatible substeps and small programs (PAL-style). Produces uncertainty estimates and provenance candidates (text spans, tables/cells).\n    - Self-verification strategies: self-consistency, majority-chain aggregation, and sandboxed program execution.\n  - 5. Tool/Execution Layer (systems engineer)\n    - Statistical engines (compute effect sizes, CIs, tests), symbolic math, database/knowledge-graph queries, chart analysis tools, external retrieval to corpora.\n    - Deterministic logging and provenance capture for reproducibility.\n  - 6. Verifier & Calibration Layer (ML researcher + domain scientist)\n    - Compare internal outputs to tool outputs; flag contradictions and low-confidence claims; calibrate reported confidence (Brier score, calibration curves).\n  - 7. Synthesis Generator & Human-in-the-loop UI (domain scientist + UX)\n    - Produce final human-readable syntheses annotated with provenance, numeric recomputations, and flags for unresolved ambiguity.\n\n- (G) Proposed experiments, datasets & benchmarks\n  - Modality-specific tests:\n    - Structured tables/charts: TabFact (table fact verification), ChartQA / PlotQA (chart QA), synthetic multi-table aggregation tasks.\n    - Unstructured text: controlled scientific-synthesis tasks from PubMed articles (extract methods/results, synthesize across N studies), S2ORC-based multi-document reasoning.\n  - Cross-modal synthesis tasks:\n    - Tasks that require combining text and tables: e.g., synthesize a claim that integrates numerical table evidence with prose-based methodological caveats.\n  - Baselines to compare:\n    - External-only pipeline: parsers \u2192 deterministic computations \u2192 template-based synthesis + human review.\n    - Internal-only pipeline: LLM-only synthesis with CoT and retrieval augmentation.\n    - Hybrid: orchestrator-driven approach described above.\n\n- (H) Evaluation metrics & acceptance criteria\n  - Faithfulness / Verifiability:\n    - Fraction of claims that can be re-executed/verified by tool layer (numeric recomputation success rate).\n    - Contradiction rate across provenance evidence.\n  - Inferential depth:\n    - Human-rated novelty/usefulness of hypotheses and multi-hop reasoning depth (scored by domain experts).\n  - Reliability & calibration:\n    - Calibration metrics (Brier score, reliability diagrams), hallucination rate (false factual claims per summary).\n  - Scalability & cost:\n    - Documents processed per unit time, tool / human time per paper, compute cost per synthesis.\n  - End-to-end utility:\n    - Domain expert acceptability: fraction of syntheses approved for decision-making or publication support.\n\n- (I) Verification strategy & human-in-the-loop policy\n  - Automated-first, selective-verification:\n    - Automatically verify any claim that is numeric, causal, or high-impact via the tool execution layer.\n    - Use confidence thresholds for non-numeric claims: if internal confidence < threshold or contradictory evidence found, escalate to human review.\n  - Provenance-first reporting:\n    - All final claims must include evidence pointers (sentence spans, table cell coordinates, executed query outputs).\n  - Human review triage rules:\n    - Manual review for tiered outputs: (A) high-confidence automation (no human), (B) medium-risk (light human spot-check), (C) high-risk (full human review).\n\n- (J) Risks, limitations & mitigations\n  - Risk: LM hallucinations producing plausible but unsupported syntheses.\n    - Mitigation: require DIR-executability for checkable claims; enforce abstention when provenance weak.\n  - Risk: parser brittleness across chart/table styles leading to incorrect numeric grounding.\n    - Mitigation: invest in robust multimodal extraction, domain adaptation, and active learning with human annotators.\n  - Risk: cost of human oversight prohibitive at scale.\n    - Mitigation: prioritized human review, automated triage, and progressive trust calibration.\n  - Risk: overfitting orchestrator policies to benchmark tasks.\n    - Mitigation: evaluate across diverse domains, use cross-validation and holdout corpora.\n\n- (K) Timeline & milestones (suggested 6\u201312 month plan)\n  - Month 0\u20131: Plan & resource allocation; run web_search_agent + deep researcher harvest; finalize DIR design.\n  - Month 2\u20134: Implement parsers, DIR prototyping, tool execution layer integration; build simple orchestrator policy.\n  - Month 5\u20137: Train/finetune internal reasoner for DIR-emitting outputs (PAL-style); integrate self-verification.\n  - Month 8\u201310: Benchmark on TabFact / ChartQA / PubMed synthesis tasks; iterate.\n  - Month 11\u201312: Human evaluation, deployment of human-in-the-loop UI, release dataset and evaluation suite.\n\n- (L) Concrete next steps (actionable)\n  - A1: Run deep_researcher_agent with the ORIGINAL TASK verbatim to collect full-texts and repos for the prioritized references listed above.\n  - A2: Design a minimal DIR schema capturing numeric claims, units, and provenance pointers and implement it for TabFact + a small sample of PubMed articles.\n  - A3: Prototype a conservative orchestrator policy: always execute numeric claims and escalate ambiguous multi-document claims to humans.\n  - A4: Evaluate prototype on a small held-out set and measure faithfulness and depth via domain-expert ratings.\n\n- (M) Bottom-line recommended integrated approach (one-sentence summary)\n  - Build an adaptive \"Reasoning Orchestrator\" that: (1) normalizes multimodal inputs into an executable Declarative Intermediate Representation (DIR), (2) lets internal autonomous reasoning propose deep hypotheses and emit DIR-formatted subclaims, and (3) systematically verifies computable subclaims with deterministic tools and selectively escalates ambiguous/high-impact items to human experts \u2014 thereby reconciling reliability, scalability, and inferential depth across unstructured text and structured tables/charts.\n</research_outline>",
