  "question": "\nGiven the progression of AI's role across the three stages of academic peer review\u2014from a logistical facilitator in the Pre-Review stage (automating desk-reviews and reviewer matching) to a direct content generator in the In-Review stage (employing single-agent, iterative, and multi-agent systems to create reviews and meta-reviews), and finally to a shaper of scholarly legacy in the Post-Review stage (predicting influence and enhancing promotion)\u2014how does this evolving spectrum of AI intervention fundamentally challenge and redefine the traditional criteria for scholarly quality, the division of labor between humans and machines, and the very definition of what constitutes a valid and impactful academic contribution?\n",
  "research_plan": "<research_outline>\n(1) Research objective\n- Precisely state the central research question: How does AI\u2019s progressive intervention across Pre-Review, In-Review, and Post-Review stages challenge and redefine (a) scholarly quality criteria, (b) the human\u2013machine division of labor, and (c) the definition of valid and impactful academic contribution?\n- Sub-goals:\n  - Map conceptual changes in quality metrics (provenance, reproducibility, fairness, machine-assessable artifacts).\n  - Empirically document workflows and outcomes where AI is used in review (triage, review generation, influence prediction).\n  - Produce actionable governance recommendations (disclosure, attribution, evaluation metrics, audits).\n\n(2) Definitions & conceptual framing (literature review tasks)\n- Clarify terms: \"Pre-Review\", \"In-Review\", \"Post-Review\"; \"scholarly quality\"; \"epistemic authority\"; \"valid contribution\"; \"AI-assisted/AI-generated\".\n- Map existing standards and policy statements to review (sources: COPE, ICMJE, Nature, Science, IEEE, funder guidance).\n- Identify prior empirical and conceptual work on algorithmic mediation of peer review, automated triage, LLM reviewers, and impact prediction.\n- Deliverable: annotated bibliography + short synthesis (policy map and concept glossary).\n- Tool/team: deep_researcher_agent (lead) + web_search_agent; output corpus_v1.\n\n(3) Empirical evidence collection (corpus & case studies)\n- Systematically collect: journal policies, editorial statements, conference workflows, published experiments comparing human vs. AI reviews, known cases of AI-generated reviews/meta-reviews, and impact-prediction tools used by publishers/funders.\n- Structured metadata capture: source, date, model/tool names, usage context (triage/review/post), disclosed provenance, measured outcomes (time-to-decision, acceptance rates, citation forecasts).\n- Deliverable: corpus_v2 (CSV/JSON + PDFs/URLs + PRISMA log).\n- Tool/team: deep_researcher_agent (lead) using web_search_agent to fetch; planning_tool to track progress.\n\n(4) Thematic qualitative synthesis (how AI redefines quality & labor)\n- Codebook creation: codes for quality aspects (novelty, validity, reproducibility, provenance, fairness), labor roles (triage, checking, drafting, adjudication), credit/authorship, and governance elements.\n- Qualitative synthesis tasks:\n  - Extract claims and evidence about changed criteria (e.g., provenance as first-class quality metric, machine-assessable reproducibility).\n  - Extract descriptions of shifted human roles and new professional roles (AI auditors, provenance officers).\n  - Identify ethical and bias concerns documented in cases/policies.\n- Deliverable: coded dataset + conceptual framework diagram mapping AI roles -> effects on quality/labor/contribution.\n- Tool/team: deep_analyzer_agent (lead) + deep_researcher_agent for validation; produce analysis_v1.\n\n(5) Quantitative analyses and simulations (measure impacts and failure modes)\n- Data sources: bibliometrics (OpenAlex/CrossRef), editorial statistics (time-to-decision, desk-rejection rates where available), experiments from literature, synthetic simulation parameters.\n- Empirical analyses:\n  - Compare outcomes where AI triage/assistant used vs. not used (acceptance patterns, time-to-decision, disciplinary variation).\n  - Model influence forecasts: evaluate predictive features and potential feedback loops (popularity reinforcement).\n  - Simulate scenarios: no-AI baseline, augmentation (AI assists humans), substitution (AI drafts reviews judged without human oversight), and biased-AI scenarios to quantify harms (e.g., under-representation of regions/methods).\n- Deliverable: reproducible analysis notebooks, simulation code, sensitivity analyses.\n- Tool/team: deep_analyzer_agent (lead) with data inputs curated by deep_researcher_agent; planning_tool for coordination.\n\n(6) Governance, norms & policy interventions to study\n- Compile candidate interventions to test or recommend: mandatory AI-disclosure (who used what model/ prompts), provenance logs for AI outputs, human-signoff requirement, audit mechanisms for reviewer-AI tools, contribution taxonomy updates (CRediT+AI roles), and promotion metric safeguards.\n- For each intervention, specify empirical indicators to evaluate (e.g., detection rates of AI use, changes in acceptance diversity, reproducibility scores, incidence of gaming).\n- Deliverable: prioritized policy matrix (intervention, intended effect, risks, feasibility, metrics).\n- Tool/team: deep_researcher_agent + deep_analyzer_agent; stakeholder review via planning_tool.\n\n(7) Verification, validation and ethics checks (built into each step)\n- Pre-registered analytic plan before running major quantitative tests.\n- Inter-coder reliability targets (\u22650.7) for qualitative coding; double-coding and adjudication logs.\n- Reproducibility: all analyses must be executable from provided notebooks and data (or documented restricted-data procedures).\n- External review: obtain feedback from two external experts (STS/ethics; bibliometrics/publishing) and at least three stakeholder orgs (publisher, university research office, funder).\n- Privacy/Data governance: IRB/PIA checks for any non-public editorial or reviewer data; redaction or synthetic-proxy alternatives if necessary.\n- Tool/team: planning_tool to coordinate checks; deep_analyzer_agent to run reproducibility validations.\n\n(8) Outputs, timelines & deliverables (practical research plan)\n- Phase A (Weeks 0\u20138): protocol, definitions, and corpus_v1 (deep_researcher_agent + web_search_agent).\n- Phase B (Weeks 6\u201320): coding, thematic synthesis (deep_analyzer_agent) and interim conceptual framework.\n- Phase C (Weeks 16\u201336): quantitative analyses & simulations (deep_analyzer_agent); preregistered analytic plan.\n- Phase D (Weeks 28\u201340): policy/practical recommendations, template disclosures, contribution taxonomy proposals, and final report.\n- Final deliverables: XML <research_outline> (this document), annotated bibliography, coded dataset, analysis notebooks, policy brief, reproducibility package, and slide deck for stakeholders.\n- Tool/team assignment summary:\n  - deep_researcher_agent: literature & corpus collection, policy mapping, stakeholder liaison.\n  - web_search_agent: focused retrieval and targeted policy gap-filling.\n  - deep_analyzer_agent: qualitative coding, quantitative analysis, simulations, reproducibility checks.\n  - planning_tool: protocol management, step marking, timeline and stakeholder coordination.\n  - final_answer_tool: packaging and delivering final outputs (this and subsequent formal outputs).\n\n(9) Prioritized research questions & experiments (actionable next steps)\n- RQ1: How do AI-assisted triage tools change desk-reject rates and topic diversity? (experiment/observational study)\n- RQ2: How does AI draft-review quality compare to human reviews on calibration, depth, and bias? (blind comparison using human raters)\n- RQ3: Do AI influence predictors create self-fulfilling citation amplification? (simulation + causal inference on historical data)\n- RQ4: Which disclosure formats (prompt logs, model metadata, provenance bundles) are most usable and minimally invasive for peer-review workflows? (usability study)\n\n(10) Ethical & practical guardrails for research and policy\n- Always require human sign-off for editorial decisions in experimental pilots.\n- Prioritize open data sources; negotiate restricted-access agreements with clear privacy safeguards where needed.\n- Publish audit reports on algorithmic performance and bias metrics alongside policy recommendations.\n\n(11) Immediate short-term actions you can run now (low-effort, high-value)\n- Run a systematic scan of major publishers\u2019 AI-in-review policies and produce a one-page policy map (deep_researcher_agent + web_search_agent).\n- Design and preregister one blind human-vs-AI review comparison on a modest sample of manuscripts (deep_analyzer_agent to draft the experiment plan; planning_tool to preregister).\n\n</research_outline>",
