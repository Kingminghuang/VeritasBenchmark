named datasets/metrics.\n    (iii) Clear integrated approach that enables scientific synthesis beyond extraction.\n\n(1) Clarify scope, definitions, and objectives\n  (a) Strategies:\n    (i) External augmentation: human-in-the-loop workflows; retrieval/citation grounding; code/SQL/statistics/unit-conversion tools; structured inputs for tables/charts; constrained decoding and verifiers.\n    (ii) Internal autonomy: self-questioning, chain/tree-of-thought, reflection/debate/consistency checks, meta-reasoning; neural program induction; minimal external reliance at inference.\n  (b) Modalities:\n    (i) Unstructured scientific text: narrative prose, methods, results, limitations, captions; long-range discourse with hedging and implicit assumptions.\n    (ii) Structured artifacts: tables (heterogeneous schemas, hierarchical headers); charts/figures (visual encodings, axes, legends, multi-panel composition).\n  (c) Criteria:\n    (i) Reliability: factual/quantitative correctness, calibration, faithfulness to evidence, robustness to noise/shifts.\n    (ii) Scalability: compute/latency, engineering/maintenance, domain transfer cost, human oversight load.\n    (iii) Inferential depth: multi-hop/cross-document synthesis, causal/abductive reasoning, hypothesis formation.\n  (d) Objective: explain how trade-offs differ across strategies and modalities; propose an integrated system that achieves genuine scientific synthesis with provenance and uncertainty.\n\n(2) Modality-specific challenges and opportunities\n  (a) Unstructured text:\n    (i) Challenges: ambiguity, hedging, coreference, varying reporting standards, cross-paper contradictions, long-context integration.\n    (ii) Opportunities: rich methodological nuance, causal narratives, context for interpreting numbers.\n  (b) Tables:\n    (i) Challenges: schema heterogeneity, multi-index headers, missing units/metadata, implicit denominators, multi-table joins.\n    (ii) Opportunities: executable reasoning (filter/group/aggregate), direct numerical verification.\n  (c) Charts:\n    (i) Challenges: OCR/layout errors, log scales, dual axes, tick interpretation, digitization noise, style diversity.\n    (ii) Opportunities: high signal for trends/relations; canonicalization to data enables robust checks.\n\n(3) External augmentation strategies and trade-offs by modality\n  (a) Text + external augmentation:\n    (i) Methods: RAG with citation control; section/discourse parsers; schema-driven IE (claims/evidence); verifiers (NLI/fact-checkers); stats/causal tools; human adjudication for hard cases.\n    (ii) Reliability: high via grounding and verification; risks include retrieval bias, incomplete context, and pipeline brittleness.\n    (iii) Scalability: engineering-heavy (indexes, schemas, tool orchestration); improved with active learning, distillation of tool traces.\n    (iv) Depth: grows with program-of-thought execution and KG integration; limited by schema expressivity if too rigid.\n  (b) Tables + external augmentation:\n    (i) Methods: table structure parsing (e.g., PubTables-1M-style), schema linking, SQL/program synthesis and execution, unit normalization (e.g., Pint), integrity checks.\n    (ii) Reliability: strong when parsing is correct; main failures from header ambiguity and schema mismatch.\n    (iii) Scalability: good within known schemas; costs rise with new formats; mitigations via universal IRs and auto-schema induction.\n    (iv) Depth: strong quantitative synthesis (effect sizes, meta-analytic aggregation) if metadata is available.\n  (c) Charts + external augmentation:\n    (i) Methods: chart-type detection, chart-to-data extraction, axis/scale/units parsing, OCR with layout analysis, data-frame canonicalization.\n    (ii) Reliability: improved post-canonicalization; residual OCR/visual parsing errors are key risks.\n    (iii) Scalability: compute- and style-diversity costs; batching and cross-parser agreement help.\n    (iv) Depth: good after data extraction; narrative alignment and context still needed.\n\n(4) Internal autonomy strategies and trade-offs by modality\n  (a) Text + internal autonomy:\n    (i) Methods: self-ask, CoT/ToT, reflection/debate, self-consistency; latent discourse modeling without explicit schemas.\n    (ii) Reliability: variable; improved by multi-pass consistency but prone to unsupported synthesis without external anchors.\n    (iii) Scalability: less bespoke tooling; compute- and data-heavy; adapts quickly to new domains.\n    (iv) Depth: strong potential for abductive, cross-paper synthesis and hypothesis generation.\n  (b) Tables + internal autonomy:\n    (i) Methods: neural program induction/latent SQL; learned compositions over tabular inputs without explicit tools.\n    (ii) Reliability: fragile on units/headers and long-tail operations; numeric mistakes are hard to detect without checks.\n    (iii) Scalability: annotation-light but data-hungry; sensitive to schema/format shift.\n    (iv) Depth: capable of complex compositions; must be paired with executable verification.\n  (c) Charts + internal autonomy:\n    (i) Methods: vision-language reasoning for trends/relations without extraction.\n    (ii) Reliability: trend-level OK; poor for precise values or scale/units subtleties.\n    (iii) Scalability: broad style coverage without custom parsers; may generalize qualitatively.\n    (iv) Depth: relational insights feasible; quantitative synthesis unreliable without external checks.\n\n(5) Cross-modal trade-off synthesis (2\u00d72\u00d73)\n  (a) Reliability:\n    (i) Highest: external augmentation for tables/charts (post-parse, executable checks).\n    (ii) Medium: external augmentation for text (grounded but limited by retrieval/verification coverage).\n    (iii) Lower: internal autonomy for text (without grounding) and lowest for charts/tables (numeric precision).\n  (b) Scalability:\n    (i) Internal autonomy: fewer engineered components but higher compute; domain pretraining helps.\n    (ii) External augmentation: orchestration/human costs; amortize via caching, auto-tool selection, and trace distillation.\n  (c) Inferential depth:\n    (i) Internal autonomy: higher ceiling for creative synthesis and cross-document reasoning.\n    (ii) External augmentation: deep when chaining executable tools and KGs; otherwise tends to extraction.\n\n(6) Integrated approach to resolve tensions and enable scientific synthesis\n  (a) Architecture components:\n    (i) Perception/canonicalization: PDF/layout parsing; table structure/units normalization; chart-to-data with axis/scale handling; caption\u2013figure linking.\n    (ii) Evidence store and knowledge graph: unify text facts, tabular data, and chart-derived series with provenance and uncertainty.\n    (iii) Dual reasoning paths:\n      - Tool-centric path: retrieval with citation control; SQL/dataframe execution; stats/causal toolkits; unit/constraint checks.\n      - Autonomy path: multi-pass self-questioning, ToT planning, contradiction detection, hypothesis generation.\n    (iv) Router/arbitrator: uncertainty-aware policy to select path per subtask (modality, stakes, complexity); quantitative claims require executable or retrieved evidence.\n    (v) Dual verifiers: internal self-critique/consistency and external symbolic checks (entailment, units, recomputation).\n  (b) Learning strategy:\n    (i) Multi-objective training: faithfulness to evidence/executions, reasoning-depth supervision, calibration.\n    (ii) Distill tool-augmented traces into lighter internal skills; retain tool pathway for high-stakes steps.\n  (c) Uncertainty and safety:\n    (i) Calibrate with temperature scaling and conformal prediction; propagate uncertainty through joins/computations.\n    (ii) Human-in-the-loop triggered by disagreement/high-uncertainty/high-impact discrepancies.\n  (d) From extraction to synthesis:\n    (i) Construct evidence graphs for claims; aggregate effect sizes with uncertainty; reconcile contradictions; propose testable hypotheses with expected direction and confidence.\n\n(7) Evaluation methodology: datasets, metrics, and stress tests\n  (a) Text datasets: SciFact (claim verification), Qasper (long-form paper QA), PubMedQA (biomedical QA), Evidence Inference (intervention\u2013outcome extraction), SciREX (doc-level IE/evidence linking).\n  (b) Tables datasets: TabFact (table fact verification), WikiTableQuestions (semantic parsing pretraining), FeTaQA (free-form table QA), HiTab (hierarchical tables), PubTables-1M (structure), SciTSR (table structure recognition).\n  (c) Charts datasets: ChartQA, DVQA, PlotQA; FigureQA (synthetic; use cautiously); chart-to-text where available; caption\u2013evidence alignment tasks.\n  (d) Multimodal: ScienceQA (image+text), custom cross-modal claim sets linking text, tables, and figures.\n  (e) Metrics:\n    (i) Reliability: evidence-backed claim rate; citation precision/recall; numeric error (abs/rel); unit consistency; calibration (ECE/Brier).\n    (ii) Scalability: docs/hour; latency/cost; tool/human calls per task; maintenance cost under corpus/schema drift.\n    (iii) Depth: multi-hop success; contradiction reconciliation rate; effect-size aggregation quality; expert-rated hypothesis novelty/plausibility.\n  (f) Stress tests: noisy OCR; log vs linear scales and dual axes; ambiguous/multi-index headers; schema/style shift; conflicting literature; missing context/metadata.\n\n(8) Experimental design and ablations\n  (a) 2\u00d72 factorial: Strategy {External, Internal} \u00d7 Modality {Text, Tables/Charts}; then Hybrid routing.\n  (b) Ablations: disable tool verification; disable self-critique; remove chart-to-data; remove unit normalization; remove KG integration.\n  (c) Cost\u2013quality frontiers: plot reliability/depth vs runtime/cost to identify optimal operating points.\n  (d) Case studies: reproduce a meta-analysis (text inclusion criteria + table effect sizes + chart time series); cross-lab materials properties synthesis; detect and explain narrative\u2013numeric conflicts.\n\n(9) Risks, limitations, and mitigations\n  (a) Parser/OCR brittleness \u2192 cross-parser agreement, uncertainty-aware fusion, re-render checks.\n  (b) Hallucinated synthesis in autonomy path \u2192 mandatory evidence grounding for high-stakes claims; abstention/deferral policies.\n  (c) Schema/style drift \u2192 auto-schema induction, continuous evaluation, active learning loops.\n  (d) Data governance \u2192 licensing checks; provenance-first design; model/tool versioning and audit trails.\n\n(10) Milestones and deliverables\n  (a) M1: Robust canonicalization for tables/charts; citation-grounded text extraction; baseline reliability metrics.\n  (b) M2: Evidence store/knowledge graph with provenance; unit normalization and executable checks.\n  (c) M3: Hybrid router with dual verifiers; calibrated uncertainty propagation.\n  (d) M4: End-to-end synthesis demo on a focused domain with expert evaluation and published cost\u2013quality curves.\n  (e) Deliverables: trade-off matrix with citations; integrated system design; experimental protocol; risk/mitigation guide; best-practice playbook.\n\n(11) Verification closure\n  (a) Confirm coverage of reliability, scalability, depth across both strategies and both modalities.\n  (b) Confirm integrated approach routes precision tasks to tools and creative synthesis to autonomy with cross-verification and provenance.\n  (c) Confirm evaluation plan includes datasets, metrics, stress tests, and ablations to validate synthesis beyond extraction.\n</research_outline>",
