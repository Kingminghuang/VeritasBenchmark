  "research_plan": "<research_outline>\n(1) Frame the two-stage pipeline and core research question\n    (a) Define Stage 1: \"Related Work Retrieval\" (RWR) \u2014 services/outputs: candidate corpus, clustering/graphs, provenance.\n    (b) Define Stage 2: \"Overview Report Generation\" (ORG) \u2014 deliverables: landscape/roadmap mappings \u2192 structured section drafts \u2192 full, citation-grounded, document-level surveys.\n    (c) Central inquiry: How RWR\u2019s evolution (semantic \u2192 graph-guided \u2192 LLM-augmented \u2192 multi-agent) enables and shapes escalating ORG complexity (mapping \u2192 structured synthesis \u2192 autonomous surveys).\n\n(2) Establish conceptual and technical background\n    (a) Retrieval paradigms: lexical (BM25), dense semantic (SciBERT/SPECTER/E5/GTE), cross-encoder re-ranking, hybrid fusion.\n    (b) Scholarly graphs: citation, co-citation, bibliographic coupling, co-authorship, venue/topic graphs; heterogeneous GNNs and metapath reasoning.\n    (c) LLM augmentation: query planning/decomposition, expansion (e.g., HyDE-style), multi-hop retrieval, LLM-based re-ranking and critique.\n    (d) Multi-agent systems: planner\u2013executor\u2013verifier loops; coordinator\u2013critic; memory/tool orchestration; DAG/tree planning.\n    (e) ORG artifacts: topic/method taxonomies, timelines/trends, comparative tables, critical synthesis, gap analysis, end-to-end survey drafts.\n\n(3) Chart the evolution of RWR\n    (a) Semantic retrieval\n        (i) Dense embeddings + ANN indices;
